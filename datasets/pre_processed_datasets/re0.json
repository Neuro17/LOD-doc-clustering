At the same time, the\ndecline in exports to oil producing countries looks set to slow\nthis year.\n    West German GNP growth in 1987 will be led by renewed\nadvances in domestic consumption and investment spending, both\nof which will in turn be buoyed by an expansionary monetary\npolicy, the institute said.\n    However, it said the labour market would see only a slight\nimprovement because companies will be reluctant to hire\nadditional workers due to higher labour costs caused partly by\nagreed reductions in working hours.\n    The institute cautioned that the expansionary stance of\nmonetary policy in West Germany was likely to bring a marked\nacceleration of inflation.\n    It also warned that what it called the worldwide\nsynchronization of monetary policy heightened the risk of a new\nglobal recession. It said central banks in industrialized\ncountries, including the Bundesbank, had followed the Federal\nReserve Board's expansionary course.\n    The institute said this in turn was bound to lead\neventually to a rise in worldwide inflation and a shift in U.S.\nPolicy towards a more restrictive policy. Other central banks\nwere likely to follow suit, causing a recession that could\naggravate the debt crisis of developing countries as well as\nincrease protectionism around the world.\n    Although Germany cannot entirely shield itself from the\nnegative effects of the global synchronization of monetary\npolicy, it should do all it can to strengthen the forces of\ngrowth at home.\n    The institute said this could be done by ensuring that\nfiscal policy fosters a willingness to work and invest.

Some of them are \"too sophisticated to\nconvert into financial terms,\" one banking source said.\n    But Western economic experts say the effect of sanctions is\nimpossible to calculate.\n    They say it is blurred by the poor performance of Poland's\neconomy, and dismiss the 15 billion dlr figure as illusory.\n    \"Sanctions have provided a very useful excuse for under-\nachieving. They did have a bad effect, yes, but they only\ncontributed to largely internal, economic problems,\" one said.\n    The U.S. Imposed the measures and withdrew Most Favoured\nNation (MFN) trading status from Poland in 1982 in retaliation\nfor suppression of the Solidarity free trade union under\nmartial law. The estimated cost to the Polish economy was\noriginally devised several years ago by the Institute of\nNational Economy, an offshoot of the central planning\ncommission.\n    According to one Western envoy, an expert on Polish\neconomic affairs, it extrapolated 1979 information on growth\ntrends in trade with the United States, as well as increases in\ncredits from Western commercial and government lenders.\n    But the calculations were based on a time when trade was\nbooming and credits still flowed freely, he said, dismissing\nthe estimate as \"a theoretical projection based on a high point,\nwhich has no real scientific evaluation.\"\n    A foreign trade ministry official said Polish exports to\nthe U.S. In the late 1970s averaged around 400 mln dlrs\nannually and had fallen by half since the sanctions were\nimposed.\n    Imports have suffered, slumping from around 800 mln dlrs to\n200 mln, as credits ran out. Poland has a dwindling trade\nsurplus with the West. Last year it was one billion dlrs\nagainst a targeted 1.6 billion, official figures show.\n    Acknowledging that sanctions have lost Poland important\nU.S. Markets -- including agricultural equipment, textiles,\nchemicals and some foodstuffs -- Western economists say credits\ndried up for economic not political reasons.  \"Poland is\naccusing the West of letting economic relations deteriorate for\npolitical reasons,\" said one expert. \"It's an illusion based on a\nmisunderstanding of Western economy.\"\n    \"There's a limit to how much you can go on giving someone\nwho has no hope of repaying it,\" another said, adding that\nPoland had benefited from a global phenomenon of easy credits\nin the 1970s which were no longer today's reality.\n    Describing the 15 billion dlr assessment as \"nebulous,\" one\ndiplomat said it also included losses of hypothetical orders\nand setbacks to Polish research through the curbing of\nscientific links and exchanges.  Western officials say the\nlifting of sanctions and new MFN status will have little impact\non Poland, which has a hard currency debt of 33.5 billion dlrs\nand lacks the means to modernise its industry.\n    \"MFN doesn't really mean anything, only that Poland will not\nbe treated worse than other countries. It will be difficult to\nregain access to the U.S. Market because different forces are\nin play now,\" said one Western envoy.\n    He said Polish products were not competitive, and their\nquality was too low. Trade wars and possible protectionist\nmeasures amongst the U.S., Japan and Europe would also hamper\nPoland's efforts to regain entry.\n    Deputy foreign trade minister Janusz Kaczurba recognised\nthis fact recently.\n    Kaczurba told the official PAP news agency recently, \"Making\nup our lost position will take a long time and be uncommonly\ndifficult, and in certain cases impossible... In a period of\ntwo to three years it will be possible to increase the level of\nexports by only about 100 mln dlrs.\"\n    While Poland is unlikely to seek compensation, it says it\nhas a \"moral right\" to assistance from the U.S. Which it says\nimposed the sanctions illegally.

At 8.3 pct last year, the rate was\nway above that of Spain's major trading partners in the\nEuropean Community, which it joined a year ago.\n    To help meet this year's target of five pct, it is\ninsisting pay rises stay at that level, setting the stage for\nclashes with trade unions, who say they have made enough\nsacrifices.\n    Demonstrations by workers, students and farmers, whose\ndemands essentially involve more government spending, have\nbecome an almost daily occurrence. But Prime Minister Felipe\nGonzalez insists that the state is doing as much as it can.\n    Bankers said the reserve requirement increase could have\nsome impact on commercial lending rates but should not hit the\nmoney market too hard.\n    The Bank of Spain, which only yesterday raised its key\novernight call money rate to 13.5 pct, left it unchanged at\ntoday's auction.

375.95 billion at the end of January from\n421.00 billion at the end of December, the Finance Ministry\nsaid in a statement.\n    It said the fall was largely due to sales of foreign\ncurrency that preceded the January 11 realignment of the\nEuropean Monetary System (EMS).\n    Foreign currency reserves fell by 8.91 billion francs\nduring the month, the ministry said.\n    This reflected outflows of 10.26 billion francs through\noperations of the French exchange stabilisation fund,\ncounterbalanced by a gain of 1.35 billion francs resulting from\nthe quarterly adjustment in the value of dollar deposits held\nwith the European Monetary Cooperation Fund (FECOM).\n    But most of the decline reflected a 33.90 billion franc\ndeficit that France built up during the month with FECOM as a\nresult of using very short-term financing instruments.\n    The Bank of France, in conjunction with the Bundesbank and\nother central banks, intervened heavily in foreign exchange\nmarkets between

foreign investors continued\nto buy into a currency which offers high relative returns and\nthe possibility of short-term capital gains, dealers said.\n    Meanwhile, opinion is divided over whether the Bank can\nstop a cut before Budget Day, March 17, and why it should want\nto.\n    The Bank's latest strong signal to the market that it wants\nrates to stay steady for the moment came in

on the foreign exchanges, talk of which had\ninhibited strong rises yesterday and Tuesday, so buyers came\nstrongly into the pound.\n    The pound surged to a high of 1.5798/808 dlrs at the London\nclose, up from the previous finish at 1.5650/60, and 2.8900/60\nmarks, up from 2.8720/50.\n    \"If this pressure keeps up...There is a possibility that\nrates could drop before the Budget,\" said Jeremy Hale, economist\nat finance house Goldman Sachs International Corp.\n    Some gilt traders are forecasting a half-point cut in the\nbase rate from the current 11 pct as early as tomorrow.\n    However, analysts said the Bank of England will need to be\nconvinced that the present rise is a fundamental re-rating\nrather than a result of short-term speculative gains.\n    There are valid reasons for the Bank to be cautious, said\nPeter Fellner, U.K. Economist at brokers James Capel and Co.\n    Markets have become highly optimistic about the chances of\na Conservative Party victory in any early general election, and\ndisappointment if Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher decides to\nhold back could lead to a decline in the pound and a setback\nfor bonds, Fellner said.\n    An election could be delayed until mid-1988, but most\nforecasts say it will be this year.\n    Others note that the pound could yet prove vulnerable to\noil price losses or a change of fortune for the dollar.\n    However, analysts agree the Bank is largely trying to set\nthe timing of a cut than holding out against one altogether.\n    The authorities traditionally prefer a single sustainable\nrate move, one way or the other, to half points here and there.\n    Some add the Bank will be influenced by signs that at least\na proportion of the latest bout of sterling buying is long-term\ncapital coming into the London market, notably from Japan.\n    They argue that the pound is being perceived as a safer bet\nthan the dollar, given the latters recent sharp falls and\ncurrent political upheavals in Washington.\n    The Bank may want to see another few points on the\ntrade-weighted index before the Budget, argued Lewis. \"But by\nthen sterling should be firm enough to satisfy even the Bank of\nEngland,\" he added.\n    The Bank declined to comment on its reasons for resisting\npressure for a rate move before the budget, but banking sources\nsaid the authorities see the recent rise in sterling as more\nthan just marking up by foreign exchange traders.\n    Meanwhile, analysts noted the market ignored potentially\nharmful news on the trade front, today's figures showing that\nthe current account deficit in 1986 was 1.1 billion stg.\n    This was above previous estimates of the current account\ndeficit and compares with a surplus of 2.9 billion

M-1 in the last 52 weeks has grown at a 16.7 pct\nrate and at a 19.1 pct rate in the past 13 weeks.\n    Moreover, some of the contraction in M-2 can probably be\nexplained by a shift of funds from savings vehicles into the\nbooming stock market and is thus not an indication of a\nslowdown in the business expansion.\n    But the data raise the tantalizing possibility for the bond\nmarkets that the slowdown in money growth is partly a\nreflection of a weaker economy that needs more Fed stimulus.\n    McCarthy noted that the slower money growth coincides with\nsigns that the economy is losing momentum as the quarter\nprogresses. \"Some of the economic indicators are not as rosy as\nthey were a month ago,\" he noted.\n    He expects only five to six pct M-1 growth in March and\nrises in M-2 and M-3 of about four pct.\n    Slifer sees stronger growth of 10 pct in M-1 and five pct\nor less for M-2 and M-3, but the rates would still be moderate\nenough to encourage the Fed to ease policy if gross national\nproduct for the first quarter proved to be weak. \"You'd\ncertainly be more inclined to ease than you would in the past.\"\n    There was certainly nothing in the Fed's latest balance\nsheet, however, to suggest a change of policy is already under\nway, economists said.

Spending and taxing decisions should\nbe linked more closely.\n    Sprinkel said the Administration still looks for 2.7 pct\ngrowth in U.S. Real gross national product (GNP) in 1987 and\n3.5 pct in 1988.\n    Asked if the latest economic reports signal this rate of\neconomic growth is attainable, Sprinkel said, \"It looks pretty\ngood to me. We've had two very strong employment reports.\"\n    He also said federal reserve policy is appropriate, adding,\n\"It looks like they're on track.\"\n    While further reductions are needed in the trade deficit,\nSprinkel said the lower dollar is having an impact.\n    The new 1987 tax laws will not hurt the economy and the tax\nreform act of 1986 significantly lowers tax rates and will\ngreatly increase private production incentives, he said.\n    \"Our estimates at the Council of Economic Advisers suggest\nnational net output of goods and services will permanently\nincrease by approximately two pct because of the long-run\nconsequences of tax reform,\" Sprinkel said. \"In 1986, this would\nhave amounted to an increase of approximately 600 dlrs in the\nincome of the average American family.\"\n    Sprinkel also argued the 1981 tax cuts were not responsible\nfor the large increase in the budget deficit.\n    In fiscal 1986 ending September, federal spending amounted\nto 23.8 pct of GNP, while federal receipts absorbed 18.5 pct of\nGNP, leaving a deficit of 5.3 pct, he said.\n    Sprinkel said that, compared with fiscal 1978, the 1986\nfederal expenditure share of GNP is 2.7 percentage points\nhigher and the revenue share of GNP is virtually the same.\n    \"Contrary to the conventional wisdom, therefore, the 1981\ntax cut is not the root cause of the extraordinary budget\ndeficits of the past few years,\" Sprinkel said.\n    \"This tax cut merely rolled back the inflation-induced tax\nincreases that occurred between 1978 and 1981,\" he added.\n    However, the Congressional Budget Office's Rudolph Penner\nargued that the tax cut in 1981 was misguided.\n    \"Since making the big mistake in 1981 of cutting taxes\nenormously without any plan to decrease spending by the\nAdministration or Congress, indeed with increases in defence\nspending, now all the options (for reducing the budget deficit)\nare unpleasant,\" he said.\n    Penner said the tax cut resulted from the ideological\nturmoil in the U.S. Caused by the \"biggest sustained inflation\nin our nation's history,\" which helped foster widespread\ndistrust of government.\n    \"The American people turned on the government with tax\nrevolt at the state level and new demands on the government at\nthe national level,\" Penner said.\n    \"But their dislike of taxes exceeded their general dislike\nof spending programs. Now the correction of that 1981 mistake\ndemands that the system change a lot.\"\n    Penner sees little hope the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget\ndeficit reduction targets will be met and said the deficit will\nremain at roughly 200 billion dlrs this year.\n    He said a budget process that sets targets arbitrarily is\nnot likely to succeed.\n    \"I feel pretty safe in saying that any process that tries to\ndictate a numerical outcome from above is doomed to fail simply\nbecause there's no ... Way to enforce it,\" Penner said.\n    Penner questioned the methods by which the 1987 budget\ndeficit was cut. He said 18 to 19 billion dlrs were eliminated\nby one-time measures, such as a temporary increase in taxes\nrelated to tax reform and sales of government assets.\n    \"Another four billion dlrs was cut by what I call creative\ntiming changes, like moving the military payday from the last\nday of fiscal 1987 to the first day of fiscal 1988.

And as\nWest Germany last year refused to give in pressure from several\nEC partners and the United States to cut interest rates to slow\nthe mark's rise, the EMS had to be realigned twice to ease\nfinancial and trade strains within the community.\n    Two months ago the mark and the Dutch guilder were revalued\nby three pct and the Belgian and Luxembourg francs by two pct\nagainst other currencies in the system -- the French franc,\nItalian lira, the Irish punt and Danish crown.\n   Another frustration has been Britain's failure to lend the\nEMS political support by keeping the pound, still a major world\ncurrency, outside the system.\n    No change in the British government's attitude is expected\nbefore the country's next general elections, due by mid-1988.\n    Meanwhile, the system's last realignment, the 11th since it\nwas set up, prompted European finance ministers to ask the EC's\nhighly-secretive Monetary Committee and Committee of Central\nBank Governors to come up with suggestions for reinforcing it.\n    Their ideas are due to be unveiled when finance ministers\nhold an informal meeting in Belgium early next month.\n    But economists said the proposals are unlikely to involve\nmore than tinkering with technical details. They are sceptical\nabout the chances for any fundamental change.\n    \"Technical measures won't be enough to protect the EMS\nagainst external factors such as dollar weakness. For that we\nmust take the step forward to the institutional level,\" said Leo\nde Corel of Kredietbank's economic research department.\n    Economists say the system's fortunes now will depend\nlargely on the success of an agreement last month among major\nindustrial nations to stabilise exchange rates.

But even if German banking authorities\nagree with some of the assessments of swaps, they disagree on\nhow to find balance sheet equivalents for the risk.\n    U.S.-British proposals include a complicated series of\nformulae for assessing the stream of payments involved in\nswaps, whose ultimate risk is borne by the financial\nintermediary, especially when counterparties remain anonymous.\nThis is the so-called market-to-market value.\n    But German authorities are likely to consider this much too\ncomplex and to base their evaluation instead on a schedule of\nlending ratings assigned according to the creditworthiness of\nthe borrowers involved, the sources said.\n    The weightings, also likely if lending ratios are extended\nto include banks' securities portfolios, are zero for public\nauthorities, 20 pct for domestic banks, 50 pct for foreign\nbanks and 100 pct for other foreign and non-bank borrowers.\n    A further complication is that the more flexible\ndefinitions of equity allowed in the U.S. And the U.K. May put\nGerman banks at a competitive disadvantage, the sources said.\n    Stricter definitions here also mean the use of a version of\nthe U.S.-U.K. Proposals could far exceed the intent of the U.S.\nAnd British authorities, the sources said.\n    One specialist for Dresdner Bank AG said a long-dated\nforeign exchange forward transaction could, for instance, be\nbrought under the same rule as a cross-currency swap, despite\nthe fact that the risk may be entirely different.\n    How new regulations will affect foreign banks here was\nuncertain. Many have converted to full subsidiary status and\napplied for a full banking licence over the last two years in\norder to lead-manage mark eurobonds.\n    But as their equity capital is fairly small, tight lending\nratios will severely hamper foreign banks' freedom of movement,\nparticularly in the growing business of currency swaps, if they\nare required to include more transactions in the balance sheet,\nthe sources added.\n REUTER\n", "West German retail turnover rose a\nreal one pct in January compared with the same month a year\nearlier, according to provisional data from the Federal\nStatistics Office.\n    There were 26 shopping days in January this year, the same\nas in January 1986, a Statistics Office statement said.\n    A Statistics Office official added retail turnover had\nrisen by 7.6 pct in December compared with the year-ago month,\na slight upward revision from the 7.5 pct increase\nprovisionally posted.\n REUTER\n", "Bangladesh's broad-based M2 money supply\nrose 6.95 pct to 132.79 billion taka in December after rising\n0.51 pct to 124.16 billion in November and 3.07 pct to 114.22\nbillion in December 1985, the Central Bank said.\n    On a year on year basis, M2 rose 16.25 pct in the 12 months\nto December, 12.04 pct to November and 16 pct to December 1985.\n    Narrowly-based M1 rose 9.55 pct to 50 billion taka against\na fall of 0.45 pct to 45.64 billion in November and a 3.03 pct\nrise to 45.51 billion to December 1985, it added.\n    Year on year, M1 rose 9.86 pct in December.\n REUTER\n", "Swiss unemployment edged down to 0.9 pct\nof the working population from one pct in January and in\nFebruary 1986, the Federal Office of Industry, Trade and Labour\nsaid.\n    Seasonally adjusted, however, there was a slight rise in\nunemployment.\n    The number out of work fell to 28,439, down 1,142 compared\nwith the previous month.

But many economists say the system,\nwhich holds eight European Community currencies within narrow\nfluctuation bands, remains in its infancy.\n    Its new currency, the European Currency Unit (Ecu), has\nbeen a runaway success with investors and borrowers alike\nseeking an alternative to the volatile dollar.\n    And on Wednesday, the long term vision of the Ecu as\nEurope's common currency took a step nearer to becoming reality\nwhen Belgium minted the world's first Ecu coin.\n    But economists say members such as West Germany have so far\nblocked a second stage of development envisaged by the system's\nfounding fathers, ex-West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and\nformer French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing.\n    Under this phase, originally due to have started two years\nafter the EMS was set up, decision-making was to have been\ntransferred from national governments and central banks to an\nautonomous European Monetary Fund.\n    But members have jealously guarded their sovereignty in\neconomic and monetary matters. \"The basic problem of the EMS is\nthat governments are not prepared to make the quantum leap to a\nsituation where certain decisions are taken in common,\" said one\neconomist who has closely watched the system's development.\n    The result is that the EC is often divided over policy on\nthird currencies, accentuating what the economists say is the\nsystem's greatest weakness, its vulnerability to a weak dollar.\n    Over the past 18 months, as the U.S. Dollar plunged and\ninvestors moved into strong currencies, the resulting sharp\nrise of the West German mark severely strained the system.\n    Another frustration has been Britain's failure to lend the\nEMS political support by keeping the pound, still a major world\ncurrency, outside the system.\n    No change in the British government's attitude is expected\nbefore the country's next general elections, due by mid-1988.\n    Meanwhile, the system's last realignment, the 11th since it\nwas set up, prompted European finance ministers to ask the EC's\nhighly-secretive Monetary Committee and Committee of Central\nBank Governors to come up with suggestions for reinforcing it.\n    Their ideas are due to be unveiled when finance ministers\nhold an informal meeting in Belgium early next month.\n    But economists said the proposals are unlikely to involve\nmore than tinkering with technical details.

is to be financed out of a 7.5 billion franc\ncontingency fund announced on February 25.\n    Finance Minister Edouard Balladur previously ruled out a\nreflationary program.\n    Long-term unemployment, defined as being out of work for\nmore than one year, affects about 830,000 people or one third\nof French unemployed, government figures show.\n    The main measures of the employment

Balladur ruling out\neconomic stimulation despite the government's revision of its\n1987 growth forecast to about 2.0 pct from 2.8.\n    Finance ministry officials later clarified Baudouin's\nremarks, saying there was no question of any move to stimulate\nthe economy through a boost to consumer spending although\ngovernment policy allowed for increased industrial investment\nfrom the proceeds of France's five-year privatisation plan.\n    The 1987 budget allowed for 30 billion francs in revenue\nfrom privatisation, to be split between repaying national debt\nand providing state enterprises with fresh capital.\n    Some political analysts said Baudouin's comments possibly\nreflect widening differences within the RPR-UDF coalition on\nsocial issues ahead of next year's presidential

five-year\nprivatisation program with the aim of completing a third of it\nthis year, ahead of the presidential elections expected in\n1988.\n    The accelerated program could provide additional

The Taiwan dollar, which is\npegged to the U.S. dollar, has risen about 15 pct since\nSeptember 1985 while the Korean won has risen about five pct.\n    But in real terms the Taiwan dollar has been flat against\nthe U.S. unit and the won has lost seven pct, economists say.\n    \"We've not seen any lessening of competition from those\ncountries that we can attribute to currency changes,\" said\nBethlehem Steel's Wendt.\n    And so far, U.S. pleas for Taiwan and Korea to use their\nhefty export earnings to import more have had little effect.\n    Moreover, it is uncertain how far U.S. protectionism will\nget given the administration's free-trade stance. \"It's hard to\nsee that anything will be passed much before year-end.

They mark an uncoupling of movements in U.S.\nand foreign interest rates,\" Salomon Bros Inc said in a recent\nstudy.\n    It said narrowing of international interest rate spreads\nwas a major factor in the dollar's fall. These spreads will\nhave to be widened if the dollar is to be stabilized.\n    West German Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl encouraged\nthe U.S. not to cut interest rates in January when the\nBundesbank cut its own rates by half a point, to avoid\nweakening the dollar.\n    West German economists see room for further cuts in leading\nWest German rates if the dollar resumes its decline.\n    \"It's not a taboo,\" Peter Pietsch, spokesman for Commerzbank\nAG said.\n    But most economists see room for a cut in West German rates\nonly in the first half of the year, as re-emerging inflation\nwill limit room for manoeuvre later in the year.\n    The Bundesbank's average yield of public paper is already\nnearing last year's low. Last week, yields fell to around 5.50\npct, not far from the 1986 low of 5.35 pct posted in mid-April.\n Economists said the trend may cause domestic investors to\nshift some funds from short to longer-term paper. Such a move\nwould tend to flatten the yield curve between short and\nlong-term rates, which has become more pronounced since the\nBundesbank lowered its discount rate.\n    It might also facilitate a further cut in leading rates, as\nthe shift out of savings accounts into securities would slow\ngrowth of the Bundesbank's central bank money stock aggregate.\n    But conflicting with this trend are plans to increase West\nGerman tax cuts, part of the Paris currency pact designed to\nmeet U.S. demands for faster West German growth. This move may\nforce interest rates up by creating a revenue vacuum which must\nbe filled by higher government borrowing.\n    This may not occur if private sector demand for credit\nremains weak, but demand could emerge if rates begin rising.\n    Economists said it appeared the government had already\nstepped up borrowing this year to accomodate revenue loss from\nother sources, including tax losses resulting from weaker than\nexpected economic growth, and higher than expected spending.\n    Josef Koerner, chief economist of the West German\nIfo-Institut, said in a newspaper interview he expected 1987\ntax revenue to be some 11 billion marks below estimates by the\nWest German government in November.\n    Any tax shortfall in itself is unlikely to push yields up.\nBut coupled with other factors such as waning foreign\nspeculative buying of mark bonds on the dollar's decline, long\nterm yields may to have to rise, economists said.\n    Public authority borrowing in 1988 may also rise owing to\nincreases in the second phase of Bonn's tax reform package.\n    The West German government is raising its total tax cuts in\n1988 by 5.2 billion marks to 14.4 billion.\n    West German chancellor Helmut Kohl said last week increased\nborrowing to finance the tax reform is acceptable.\n    Finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said last Thursday he\nwas looking for other ways to finance the reform, such as\nraising indirect taxes.\n    But few economists believe the government will be able to\ngo through with its tax measures without increasing net\nborrowing.\n    The Bundesbank said in its February report that it was\nwrong to believe that the first stage of the tax reform in 1986\ncould be managed without increasing deficits.\n    The Bundesbank said West German public authorities borrowed\na large 21.9 billion marks in credit markets in the 1986 final\nquarter compared with 14.8 billion in fourth quarter 1985.\n    The federal government took up nearly 10 billion marks of\nthe fourth quarter 1986 figures, and also drew on two billion\nmarks of Bundesbank advances at the end of the year, when it\nhad not required such a credit in the 1985 quarter.\n

Hutton and Co.\n    Citibank's surprise base rate increase, quickly followed by\nChase, sent U.S. bond prices lower and the dollar higher.\n    McCulley said that once the spread between three-month\ncertificates of deposit and the prime rate narrows to less than\n1-1/2 percentage points, there is a strong chance of a prime\nrate increase. It has been under 1-1/4 points recently.\n    However, banks are likely to hold rate increases until they\nsee what the Fed intends to do about interest rates in the near\nterm, analysts said. They noted that banks historically like to\nfollow Fed rate movements, rather than lead them. For example,\nthe last prime rate increase occurred in June 1984 when banks\nlifted the rate to 13 pct from 12-1/2 pct after a Fed discount\nrate increase in April of that year.\n    Major banks had been posting a 7-1/2 pct prime rate since\nlast August 26/27, when they lowered the rate from eight pct\nshortly after the Fed's half-point discount rate cut to the\ncurrent 5-1/2 pct level on August 20.\n    \"The banks will not rush to raise their prime rates. There\nshould be a split prime for a while with some posting a 7-1/2\npct rate and others 7-3/4 pct,\" said David Jones of Aubrey G.\nLanston and Co.\n    Jones said the Federal Open Market Committee at today's\nmeeting voted no change in Fed policy. But he said the Fed may\nwell foster higher interest rates soon.\n    Jones said that, while the FOMC probably voted no policy\nchange today, it may have decided to apply slight upward rate\npressure later if the dollar weakens, inflation pressures heat\nup or the economy shows sign of strong recovery.\n    \"The Fed clearly indicated that they did not intend to\ntighten policy when they did today's coupon pass,\" said Joseph\nLiro of S.G. Warburg and Co.\n    In a move that came a day earlier than most expected, the\nFed today supplied permanent reserves to the banking system by\noffering to buy all maturities of Treasury notes and bonds for\nits own account. This seasonal reserve add is called a \"pass.\"\n    \"The Fed demonstrated that there has been no policy\nchange,\" said Elizabeth Reiners, economist at Dean Witter\nReynolds Inc. \n    She said the spread between banks' cost of funds and the\nprime rate is now around 137 basis points compared with a 153\nbasis point average in 1986. Reiners said the spread is not\nreally narrow enough to present a clear need for a prime rate\nincrease.\n    The Dean Witter economist said that today's prime rate rise\n\"may have been less a response to interest rates than an\nattempt to enhance the (balance sheet) bottom line.\"\n    Reiners said that, given recent problems with loans to\ndeveloping countries, large money center banks with heavy\nexposures might be the first to match the higher prime rate in\nan effort to get more profitable spreads on other loans.\n    The Federal funds rate at which banks lend overnight money\nto one another could help determine how many banks match the\nhigher prime rate and also how quickly they move.\n    In raising their prime rates, banks cited a higher cost of\nfunds. In the three business days through Monday, the Federal\nfunds rate at which banks lend to one another averaged nearly\n6-1/4 pct. But quarter end pressures helped push up funds.  \n    The Fed funds rate was extremely volatile today, reflecting\ndemand pressure associated with the end of the quarter and the\nclose of the Japanese fiscal year. Funds traded between five\nand 6-3/4 pct.\n    Once the special distortions end, analysts said the funds\nrate probably will return to its recent trading level in the\n6-1/8 pct area. They said that, if it stabilizes near there,\nbanks may not quickly boost their prime rates.\n    But a consistently higher funds rates would suggest to many\nthat the Fed was fostering somewhat higher interest rates to\nhelp the dollar. Then banks would lift prime rates quickly.\n Reuter\n", "The complex task of wielding control\nover monetary policy in an increasingly fast-moving global\neconomy could be aided by tying policy to commodity prices, the\nnewest member of the Federal Reserve Board says.\n    Commodity prices are already considered by the Fed in the\nmaking of monetary policy. But they would be given a much\ngreater role under an idea being floated by Governor Robert\nHeller, who joined the board last August.\n    He conceeds that much more study of the idea is needed, but\nargues that such an arrangement, particularly if it were\nadopted by other major industrial countries, could reduce the\nvolatility of exchange rates.\n    Moreover, it could help stabilize of the prices of\ncommodities themselves, slowing changes in inflation.\n    His idea, which many conservative economists find\nappealing, has some backing among board members appointed in\nrecent years by President Reagan.\n    It would complement the present system of opening or\nclosing the monetary screws based on the pattern of inflation,\nkey indicators such as unemployment, and the rise or fall of\nthe money supply. Changes in the money supply can lead to\nchanges in interest rates and affect economic activity\ndirectly.\n    Discussed on and off for a long time, the commodity concept\nis part of a growing search for a system that anchors monetary\npolicy and widely-fluxtuating currency prices to a more solid\nbase.\n    \"What is needed is an anchor or reference point that can\nserve as a guide for both domestic and international monetary\npurposes,\" says Heller.\n    In the past, this anchor was gold but the United States\nwent off the gold standard because the global economy had\nvastly outstripped gold supplies.\n    A return to the gold standard is generally dismissed out of\nhand by most policymakers on the grounds that the largest\nproducers of gold are the Soviet Union and South Africa.\n    The so-called fixed rate system, scuttled in the early\n1970s, is still considered unworkable in the present world.\n    But the current system of floating currencies in which\ncurrencies can fluxtuate widely, adding vast pressures to the\nmonetary system, is also being widely questioned.\n    Some have suggested that the system might benefit from a\nformal approach that mandates intervention by countries when\ncurrencies wander above or below agreed to levels but there are\nmajor problems with this also.\n    For one thing, there is justifiable concern that countries\nmight be relunctant to intervene if they felt it might be\ndetrimental to their own domestic economy.\n    Moreover, some question whether concerted intervention can\nmake much of an inpact if the overall market does not agree\nwith the fundamental judgement.\n    The poorest countries have called for a monetary conference\nto work out a new system that, not surprisingly, helps them\ncope with their overpowering debt problems.\n    Treasury Secretary James Baker, the Reagan administration's\nchief economic architect, has preferred to use the so-called\nGroup of Five industrial countries or sometimes, Seven, as a\nforum to work out cooperative agreements on currency and other\neconomic matters.\n   He appears convinced that officials from West Germany,\nFrance, Britain, Japan, Italy and Canada talking quietly behind\nclosed doors can reached reasoned decisions away from public\nposturing.\n   The Heller approach, while extremely complex, could have a\nprofound impact on the system, ideally stabalizing prices and\ninternational exchange rates.\n    As envisioned by Heller, a basket of say, 30 major\ncommodities ranging from wheat to oil, would be put together\nand prices would be measured on a regular basis.\n    \"In times of rising commodity prices, monetary policy might\nbe tightened and in times of falling commodity prices, montary\npolicy might be eased,\" he says.\n    He notes that commodity prices are traded daily in auction\nmarkets, and a commodity price index can be calculated on a\nvirtually continuous basis.\n    Moreover, most commodity prices are produced, consumed and\ntraded on a world-wide basis, so \"that an index has a relevance\nfor the entire world,\" he says.\n    In addition, commodity prices are at the beginning of the\nproduction chain and serve as an imput into virtually all\nproduction processes.\n    \"Focusing on commodity prices as an early and sensitive\nindicator of current and perhaps also future prices pressures,\nthe monetary authorities may take such an index into account in\nmaking their monetary policy decisions,\" he says.\n    However, he says that any major change in a basic commodity\nsuch as occurred in oil during the 1970s because of action by\nthe OPEC cartel, would have to be discounted in such a system.\n    He says the worst thing that could happen is to allow\nmonetary policy to spread a freakish increase in one commodity\nto the rest of the system and to other commodities.\n Reuter\n", "Australian annual broad money growth rose\n10.3 pct in February, unchanged from January, but down from

The pact was a major turning\npoint in U.S. Policy, ending a period of disdain for economic\ncooperation and intervention in currency markets.\n    Darman also worked on some other Baker initiatives, like\nthe Tokyo Summit agreement to intensify coordination of\neconomic policies among the leading industrial countries and\nthe recent Paris Agreement to stabilise currencies and\nstimulate global growth.\n    These policies are collectively aimed at redressing the\nhuge gap between Japan and West Germany's trade surpluses and\nthe United State's massive trade deficit.\n    That policy goal still remains a prime objective of the\nReagan Administration and will not change with Darman's\ndeparture.\n REUTER\n", "The top accepted rate of discount at the\nweekly U.K. Treasury bill tender rose to 9.5261 pct  from\n9.3456 pct last week.\n    Applications at the lowest accepted price of 97.625 stg\n were allotted around 81 pct of the amount applied for, and\n applications above that price were allotted in full, the Bank\n of England said.\n    A total of 100 mln stg of Treasury bills was offered for\nsale this week.\n    Last week, the average rate of discount was 9.3157 pct.\n REUTER\n", "European Community finance ministers\nand central bankers meet in Belgium this weekend to discuss\nstrengthening Europe's joint currency float amid continuing\nworries about turbulence on foreign exchanges.\n    Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens, who will host the\ninformal talks, told Reuters the ministers and central bank\nchiefs would discuss the situation on currency markets in the\nlight of the February agreement among leading industrialised\ncountries to stabilise exchange rates around present levels.\n    In an interview, Eyskens said he felt the Paris accord\nbetween the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain\nand Canada had proved itself \"more or less workable.\"\n    But doubts over its effectiveness and durability have been\ngrowing since fears of a trade war between the United States\nand Japan over computer microchips pushed the dollar to a\nrecord low against the surging yen early this week.\n    The talks, at the Belgian resort of Knokke, are being held\nto coordinate the EC's positions on monetary issues and Third\nWorld debt ahead of the Spring meetings of the International\nMonetary Fund and World Bank in Washington next week.\n    The EC gathering begins tonight with a dinner but the main\ndiscussions will take place tomorrow.\n    Continued international currency turbulence could undermine\nplans for reinforcing the European Monetary System, the joint\nfloat holding eight EC currencies within narrow fluctuation\nbands, which will feature high on the weekend agenda.\n    Eyskens has repeatedly said that Europe needs a period of\ncalm on world currency markets, and in particular a more stable\ndollar, before it can set about strengthening the EMS to make\nit more resilient against exchange rate swings.\n    The EMS has been taking a battering over the last year as\nthe falling dollar has sent funds surging into the dominant EMS\ncurrency, the West German mark, forcing ministers to undertake\ntwo major realignments of parities within nine months.\n    In the interview, Eyskens made clear he was hoping for a\nwide-ranging discussion on the future of the eight-year-old EMS\non the basis of proposals for bolstering it drawn up by the\nEC's Monetary Committee and the Committee of Central Bank\nGovernors.\n    The committees were asked to come up with the proposals\nafter the last reshuffle of EMS exchange rates in January.\n    Eyskens repeated calls for the European Currency Unit, the\nfledgling EC currency at the core of the system, to take over\nthe mark's dominant role in the EMS - a proposal that has met\nwith a cool response in West Germany.\n    He said EC Commission President Jacques Delors would report\nto the meeting on problems raised by plans to liberalise\ncapital movements fully within the 12-nation bloc by 1992, such\nas the need for harmonising taxes and banking controls.\n    Eyskens said liberalisation of capital movements without\nstrengthening the EMS would be an element of destabilisation in\nthe Community. \n    He said the crucial issue in the debate was whether member\nstates were willing to push further towards the EC's goal of\nmonetary integration on the basis of an EMS that included\nmanagement of exchange rates by some kind of common\ninstitution, instead of by national central banks as at\npresent.\n    Plans for the creation of such an institution, foreseen by\nthe EMS's founding fathers, have been thwarted by the\nreluctance of some countries, notably West Germany, to gove up\ntheir sovereignty in the monetary field.\n    EMS development has also been held up by Britain's refusal\nso far to join the system's core exchange rate mechanism.\n REUTER\n", "The U.S. civilian unemployment rate\nfell to 6.6 pct in March from 6.7 pct in February, the Labor\nDepartment said.\n    The number of non-farm payroll jobs rose 164,000 last month\nafter rising a revised 236,000 in February.

Manufacturing employment fell 25,000, compared with\nFebruary's 50,000 gain, while March construction employment\ndropped 45,000 after being unchanged in February.\n    \"The momentum of industrial activity is tapering off as we\nend the first quarter,\" said Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley\nand Co Inc. \"This sets the stage for more sluggish growth in\nthe second and third quarters.\"\n    \"The Fed will view this as a caution flag on the economy,\"\nhe said. \"They will not ease as long the dollar is weak, but\nclearly they can't tighten.\"\n    David Wyss of Data Resources Inc said that the downward\nrevision in February non-farm payroll employment to 236,000\nfrom 337,000 means that employment gains in the first quarter\nwere weaker than expected.\n    While Wyss left his first-quarter forecast of real U.S.\ngross national product growth at 3.5 pct, he said the March\njobs data suggested a downward revision in his second-quarter\ngrowth forecast to 2.5 pct from 2.8 pct.\n    Bill Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc said the average\nmonthly gain in non-farm jobs in the first quarter was only\n237,000, compared with 254,000 in the fourth quarter of 1986.\n    \"There's momentum in first quarter labor force activity, \nbut less than assumed,\" he said. \"Gains in goods-producing jobs\nwere subdued at best.

He said the March drop in industrial\nactivity \"is a reasonable response in light of the inordinate\ncontribution inventory accumulation made to GNP.\"\n    Economists said the employment data also suggest weak gains\nin industrial production and personal income for March.\nThey expect only marginal gains, if not small declines, for\nthese indicators, compared with a February increases of 0.5 pct\nin industrial production and 0.9 pct in personal income.\n    Steve Slifer of Lehman Government Securities said the drop\nin March construction employment may also signal a drop in\nMarch housing starts, which rose 2.6 pct in February to 1.851\nmillion units at an annual rate from 1.804 million units in\nJanuary.\n    The rate of unemployment fell to 6.6 pct, its lowest level\nsince March 1980, from 6.7 pct in February. But Wyss pointed\nout that this resulted from a drop in the labor force, which \nfell to 119.2 mln in March from 119.35 mln in February.\n    \"This just means that there were fewer people looking for\nwork, so the drop in unemployment doesn't mean much,\" he said.\n    He said the latest employment report will not concern the\nFed because it does points to GNP growth in the first half of\n2.5-3.0 pct, but \"it does suggest they can't afford to tighten\nto quickly either.\"\n    The statistical factors used to smooth out seasonal\nfluctuations in the jobs data may have understated March labor\nforce gains, just as seasonal factors probably overstated them\nin January and February, Slifer said, but are consistent with\nhis forecast of 1.8 pct first quarter GNP growth.\n    Economic growth remains sluggish, but Silfer does not think\nthat the Federal Open Market Committee changed policy at their\nmeeting this week. \"At some point they will be more inclined to\nease,\" he said.

Thomas Melzer, St Louis Federal Reserve Bank president\nfavored some tightening of reserve conditions.\n    He noted the strong growth in bank loans in November\nthrough January and the firm federal funds rate that had\nprevailed despite the extraordinary pace of reserve growth. He\nalso cited the recent declines in the dollar's value.\n    Finally, looking ahead, Melzer pointed out the potential\nfor a further rise in inflationary expectations. He believed\nthat prompt restraints might avert the need for more\nsubstantial tightening later.\n    Regarding inter-meeting policy adjustments, the FOMC\nminutes showed, \"the members generally felt that policy\nimplementation should be especially alert to the potential need\nfor some firming of reserve conditions.\"\n    In this view, the FOMC said somewhat greater reserve\nrestraint would be warranted if monetary growth did not slow in\nline with current expectations and there were concurrent\nindications of intensifying inflationary pressures against the\nbackground of stronger economic data.\n    One indication of potential price pressure might be a\nfurther tendency for the dollar to weaken.\n    The minutes showed that one member, presumably Melzer,\npreferred a directive that did not contemplate any easing\nduring the weeks ahead. However, \"most of the members did not\nwant to rule out the possibility of some slight easing during\nthe inter-meeting period, although they did not view the\nconditions for such a move as likely to emerge.\"\n    The FOMC members assumed that future fluctuations in the\ndollar's value would not be of sufficient magnitude to have any\nsignificant effect on the Fed's economic projections.

West German mark to a bipolar mark-sterling\nsystem, he noted. \"We have to make sure it would work.\"\n    But Lawson added that some of the considerations that had\nmade it difficult for Britain to

discussion since the\nsecond major realignment of EMS parities within nine months in\nJanuary.\n    The system has come under severe strain as funds have\nflowed out of the slumping dollar and into the dominant EMS\ncurrency, the West German mark, sending it soaring against\nweaker currencies in the system.\n    But Eyskens said February's agreement between leading\nwestern industrialised nations to stabilise exchange rates at\naround current levels was working and this would allow the EC\nto speed up its efforts to boost the internal stability of the\nEMS.\n    He told a news conference yesterday's meeting agreed on the\nneed for closer coordination among EMS member governments of\ninterest rate policies and of interest rate differentials\nbetween different countries.\n    They also agreed they needed better coordination of\nexchange market intervention to hold currencies stable, both\nwhen they reached their fixed EMS limits and within their\nagreed margins.\n    But Eyskens said this coordination raised a whole range of\ntechnical problems and ministers would discuss these further in\nLuxembourg in June on the basis of proposals from the EC's\nMonetary Committee and Committee of Central Bank Governors.\n    He said the EC needed a set of indicators of economic\nconvergence betwen Community countries and it was important\nthat interest rates fulfilled this role together with exchange\nrates and inflation rates.\n    The Belgian minister, whose country presently holds the\npresidency of the community, made clear the meeting had not\nproduced any agreement to move radically forward in developing\nthe EMS towards the EC's long term goal of economic and\nmonetary integration.\n    \"We have committed ourselves to reestablishing the

issues raised by greater\ncoordination of exchange market intervention was the question\nof which currencies should be used to intervene and held in\ncentral bank reserves.\n    He said several EMS member countries believed the EMS would\nwork better if central banks held each other's currencies -- an\nissue of particular importance regarding West Germany since the\nBundesbank holds only dollars in its foreign exchange reserves.\n    He said the debate on dedramatising EMS realignments\nreflected a general feeling among participants that the way the\nJanuary reshuffle had been conducted was

Within three to six weeks in each instance,\nhowever, Braverman said bond prices recovered to bring the\nyield down sharply by 63 to 82 basis points.\n    Mitchell Held of Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co Inc said\nthat many portfolio managers now believe yields could approach\nnine pct by midyear, which he considers unlikely.\n    Held said that, since late 1986, Smith Barney analysts have\nspoken about the risk that interest rates could move higher and\nthey continue to believe that an upward bias is likely to\npersist over the next few months.\n    Held said that in conversations with portfolio managers\nlast week there appeared to be increasing belief that the rate\nrise had just begun and that yields could approach nine pct by\nmidyear. Naturally, that would mean a sharp bond price fall.\n    \"Yields could rise further over the next few months, but the\nrise should be less than the 65 basis point rise we've seen\nsince the start of the year,\" Held said.\n    Most expect Fed policy to be neutral for bonds near term.\n    \"The Fed is currently frozen into a fixed stance,\" said\neconomists at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc.\n    They said the Fed cannot tighten policy and push up\ninterest rates as might be appropriate to stabilize the dollar\nand head off renewed inflationary psychology. That might harm\nthe fragile U.S. Economic expansion.\n    The Lanston economists said, \"The Fed cannot ease its policy\nstance to both foster more rapid economic growth and calm\ndomestic and Third World debt jitters without the threat of\ncausing a further decline in the dollar.\"\n    Minutes of February's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)\nmeeting released Friday showed that while the FOMC left policy\nunchanged it was more inclined to firm rather than ease policy\nlater if conditions in the economy, foreign exchange or credit\nmarkets warranted a policy shift.\n    However, economists generally believe that continued fairly\nsluggish U.S. Economic growth and the financial strains on U.S.\nBanks resulting from their problem loans to developing\ncountries rule out any Fed policy firming.\n    There is broad agreement among economists that the FOMC at\nlast Tuesday's meeting also left Fed policy unchanged.\n    This week's U.S. Economic data are expected to have little\nimpact.

welcomed measures outlined by\nJapanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa yesterday.\n    Lawson said he was still worried about  the risk of a\nsimultaneous recession in the United States, Japan and West\nGermany, though less so than when he gave his March 17 budget\nspeech to the British Parliament.\n    \"If anything I'm a little bit less concerned, but there is\nstill a risk,\" he said.\n

\"We believe there will be some worthwhile progress in\nreducing the deficit this year.

It is\ntaking on new prominence because of current trade woes.\n    That is because the budget problems and its associated huge\ndeficits are said to be at the root of related international\ntrade friction currently worrying financiers.\n    As the dollar slides downward on global markets and stock\nexchanges gyrate wildly, the trade dispute involving the United\nStates and Japan once again is spreading fears of a major trade\nwar between the two trading giants for the first time since\nWorld War II.\n    Ostensibly that dispute is over U.S. charges that Japan is\nrefusing to open its markets to semi-conductor chips and the\nresulting U.S. tariffs doubling prices of Japanese televisions\nand small computers.\n    Behind the elements of a brewing trade war which neither\nside wants, is the dilemma of the U.S. budget and its deficit.\n    Some analysts say the financial markets may be waking up to\nthe economic realities that the huge debt cannot continue to\ngrow without repercussions.\n    A large portion of the U.S. debt has been financed by\nforeigners from their accumulated trade surpluses. But if they\nwithdraw this support the result can only be further problems,\nincluding higher interest rates for Americans.\n    In a nutshell, the U.S. budget process has now moved to the\nshowdown stages in Congress. Reagan's own trillion dollar\nspending budget for the government year 1988, starting Oct. 1,\nwas trounced badly in the House on April 9.\n    The Senate takes up a plan similar to one that passed the\nHouse, calling for slashing the deficit from its estimated 171\nbillion dlr level next year to about 134 billion dlrs, through\ndefense and domestic spending cuts and about 18.5 billion dlrs\nin new, unspecified, taxes. As the Senate prepares to take up\nits own budget plan, majority Democrats predict there will be\npassage of a bill, only after a protracted partisan battle.\n    In the House, not one Republican voted for the budget,\nwhich passed by 230 to 192. In the Senate, none of Reagan's\nRepublicans voted for the budget as it passed out of the Senate\nBudget Committee for full Senate consideration.\n    A key Senate Budget Committee source told Reuters he\nbelieves this very unusual unanimous opposition was by design\namong congressional Republicans, perhaps with the tacit\napproval of the White House.\n    \"Republicans want Democrats to take the heat for any tax\nhikes and defense cuts,\" he said.\n    In the coming weeks, the source said, Democrats will press\nfor a bipartisan budget and seek a negotiated budget with\nReagan -- who already is opposed to the idea. But \"it is not\nclear how the Republicans will act,\" he added.\n    He said Republicans may propose their own plan for lower\ntaxes and more defense spending, which they did not offer after\nReagan's budget was clobbered in an early vote in the House.\n     When Reagan entered the White House in 1981, he inherited\nwhat was labelled a huge deficit from Jimmy Carter that wound\nup to be nearly 79 billion dlrs that year.\n    Despite Reagan's promise to balance the budget by 1983,\ncritics note that his administration's record of accumulated\ndebt is estimated over one trillion dlrs, or 1,100 billion\ndlrs.\n    That is money the government must borrow, and pay back, and\nmany analysts say it is what kept the dollar high and caused\nthe worst U.S. trade deficit ever.\n     Last year the United States bought goods from the world\nworth 169.8 billion dlrs more than what it sold, including\npurchases of 58.6 billion dlrs in Japanese goods.\n    While Congress is trying to attack the trade deficit on one\nfront through a get-tough trade bill promising retaliatory\nmeasures unless all markets are opened, its success so far\nagainst the budget deficit has been marked by limited progress.\n    Congress, which controls the pursestrings, has put the\ndeficit on a downward path from its record high of 220.7\nbillion dlrs accumulated in fiscal 1986, which ended Sept. 30.\n    Because of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings balanced budget law\nenacted in late 1985, there has been pressure on Congress to do\nmore than talk about deficits.\n    That law, named after Republican Senators Phil Gramm of\nTexas, Warren Rudman of New Hampshire and Democrat Ernest\nHollings of South Carolina, calls for a balanced budget by 1991\nthrough a series of set deficit targets that Congress must meet.\n    The law has been followed, even though an enforcement\nmechanism to mandate automatic across-the-board cuts if\nCongress misses its goal was stricken by the Supreme Court.\n    The legislators have followed the targets -- on paper. But\nin reality, the goal has actually been missed. For example,\nCongress last year approved legislation to meet the 1987 target\nof a 144 billion dlr deficit. But even after approving the\nnumbers, the deficit for 1987 is estimated at over 170 billion\ndlrs -- far off the target.\n    This year the target is 108 billion dlrs and that goal is\nexpected to be missed widely.\n Reuter\n", "Spanish Secretary of State for the\neconomy Guillermo de la Dehesa said the government maintained\nits five pct inflation target for this year although a 0.6 pct\nincrease in March pushed the rise in the year on year consumer\nprice index to 6.3 pct.\n    De la Dehesa said the March rise, announced today by the\nNational Statistics Institute, was not entirely satisfactory\nbut acceptable.\n    The year on year rate at the end of February was six pct.\nPrices rose 8.3 pct last year.\n    The March rise included a 0.05 pct increase correcting an\nerror in last January's consumer price index. Economists had\nearlier said the error could have been as high as 0.2 pct.\n    De la Dehesa said seasonal increases in food prices pushed\nthe index up in March and he expected the rate to be lower in\nApril.\n    The Communist-led Workers Commissions union said the March\nprice rise showed inflation was going up again and the\ngovernment looked increasingly unlikely to meet its five pct\ntarget.\n    The Workers Commissions said the inflation trend fuelled\nunions's claims to wage increases beyond the government's\nrecomendation to limit wage rises at around five pct.\n    Spain is being affected by a two-month-old wave of strikes\nfor wage rises. Government officials note wage settlements so\nfar this year have yielded average increases upwards of six\npct, while unions say the figure is higher then seven pct.\n REUTER\n", "U.S. banking data released today are\ntoo distorted to draw sweeping conclusions about monetary\npolicy, but they do support the market's assumption that the\nFederal Reserve has started to tighten its grip on credit,\neconomists said.\n    \"It's clear that the Fed has firmed somewhat. Discount\nwindow borrowings, net free reserves, the Fed funds rate\naverage and the pattern of reserve additions are all consistent\nwith a modest tightening,\" said Dana Johnson of First Chicago\nCorp.\n    Johnson, and several other economists, now estimate that\nthe Fed funds rate should trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8 pct.\n    Discount window borrowings in the week to Wednesday were\n935 mln dlrs a day, producing a daily average for the two-week\nstatement period of 689 mln dlrs, the highest since the week of\nDecember 31, 1986, and up from 393 mln dlrs previously.\n    Moreover, banks were forced to borrow a huge 5.2 billion\ndlrs from the Fed on Wednesday - the highest daily total this\nyear - even though unexpectedly low Treasury balances at the\nFed that day left banks with over two billion dlrs more in\nreserves than the Fed had anticipated.\n    However, economists said it is almost certain that the Fed\nis aiming for much lower discount window borrowings than\nwitnessed this week. They pointed to two factors that may have\nforced banks to scramble for reserves at the end of the week.\n    First, economists now expect M-1 money supply for the week\nended April 29 to rise by a staggering 15 to 20 billion dlrs,\npartly reflecting the parking in checking accounts of the\nproceeds from stock market sales and mutual fund redemptions to\npay annual income taxes.\n    As banks' checking-account liabilities rise, so do the\nreserves that they are required to hold on deposit at the Fed.\n    Required reserves did indeed rise sharply by 2.5 billion\ndlrs a day in the two weeks ended Wednesday, but economists\nsaid the Fed may not have believed in the magnitude of the\nprojected M-1 surge until late in the week and so started to\nadd reserves too late.\n    Second, an apparent shortage of Treasury bills apparently\nleft Wall Street dealers with too little collateral with which\nto enagage in repurchase agreements with the Fed, economists\nsaid. Thus, although there were 10.3 billion dlrs of repos\noutstanding on Wednesday night, the Fed may have wanted to add\neven more reserves but was prevented from doing so.\n    \"It's not at all inconceivable that the Fed didn't add as\nmuch as they wanted to because of the shortage of collateral,\"\nsaid Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Economics Inc.\n    McCarthy estimated that the Fed is now targetting\ndiscount-window borrowings of about 400 mln dlrs a day,\nequivalent to a Fed funds rate of around 6-3/8 pct.\n    After citing the reasons why the Fed probably has not\ntightened credit to the degree suggested by the data,\neconomists said the fact that the Fed delayed arranging \novernight injections of reserves until the last day of the\nstatement period was a good sign of a more restrictive policy.\n    Jeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank had not been convinced that\nthe Fed was tightening policy. But after reviewing today's\nfigures, he said, \"It's fair to say that the Fed may be moving\ntoward a slightly less accommodative reserve posture.\"\n    Leeds expects Fed funds to trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8\npct and said the Fed is unlikely to raise the discount rate\nunless the dollar's fall gathers pace.\n    Johnson at First Chicago agreed, citing political\nopposition in Washington to a dollar-defense package at a time\nwhen Congress sees further dollar depreciation as the key to\nreducing the U.S. trade surplus with Japan.\n Reuter\n", "Australia's M-3 money supply growth was\n1.5 pct in March and 11.3 pct in the 12 months to March, the\nReserve Bank said.\n    This compared with a revised rise of 0.5 pct in February\nand 11.1 pct in the year to end-February.\n    The Reserve Bank said the M-3 data for March was affected\nby the start of the operations of <National Mutual Royal\nSavings Bank Ltd>, which has resulted in the transfer of\ndeposits (equivalent to around 1.5 pct of m-3) from the United\nPermanent Building Society to National Mutual Royal Savings\nBank Ltd.\n    The Reserve Bank said M-3 money supply in March was 110.77\nbillion Australian dlrs compared with a revised 109.11 billion\nin February and 99.48 billion in March, 1986.\n    M-3 is deposits of the private sector held by trading and\nsavings banks plus holdings of notes and coins.\n REUTER\n", "National Mutual Royal Bank Ltd said\nit would cut its prime rate to 17.75 pct from 18.25, effective\nApril 27.\n    The cut follows a trend toward lower rates started last\nmonth and accelerated by Westpac Banking Corp, which yesterday\ncut its prime to 17.50 pct from 18.25 pct.

market.\n    The telex, issued on May 19, was signed by Carlos Hernandez\nDelfino, manager of the bank's department of international\noperations.\n    The telex said the restriction on business with foreign\nbrokers is in line with an earlier measure prohibiting foreign\nexchange houses from selling dollars or other foreign\ncurrencies to anyone living outside Venezuela.\n    In recent weeks the Venezuelan government has denied\nrumours that it intends to impose foreign exchange controls to\nprop up the weakening bolivar.\n    But brokers said the central bank's move is seen as a de\nfacto currency control. \"It is definitely a control in the sense\nthat there's no longer complete freedom to operate,\" one broker\nhere said.\n    \"Gradually they're imposing restrictions and the direction\nis towards complete control,\" the broker said.\n    The broker, who requested anonymity, said virtually all his\nVenezuelan customers had stopped doing business with him since\nthe central bank issued the telex and followed it up with\ntelephone calls.\n    He said that before the restriction was imposed the volume\nof his firm's transactions with Venezuela was about 10 mln dlrs\na day. \"It was a frenetic market, it was really quite active,\" he\nsaid.\n    The broker said he saw no logical explanation for the\nprohibition because his firm only acted act as an intermediary\nbetween Venezuelan brokers, exchange houses and banks.\n    \"We weren't buying dollars from Venezuelans, that's\nridiculous,\" he said. \"They've been on a rampage against\nforeigners.\"\n    The broker noted that two months ago Venezuela's central\nbank quietly announced that banks doing foreign exchange\nbusiness outside Venezuela would have to respect a new 200 pct\nreserve requirement.\n    In February, the central bank also prohibited trading in\nbolivar futures, the broker said.\n    \"We used to have a forward market,\" he said. \"For a small\ncurrency it was miraculous.\"\n    He said the bolivar, which averaged 20.29 to the U.S.\nDollar in 1986, would continue to slip from its current range\nof 28.35 to 28.50 because the central bank was rapidly running\nout of foreign reserves to support the currency on the free\nmarket.\n REUTER\n", "The Philippines' first quarter growth\nfigures released yesterday indicated the government was likely\nto achieve its 1987 targets, Central Bank governor Jose\nFernandez said in an interview.\n    The National Economic Development Authority (NEDA)\nannounced yesterday gross domestic product (GDP) grew 5.78 pct\nand gross national product (GNP) 5.53 pct in the first quarter\nfrom a year earlier.\n    \"I don't see anything on the horizon that should cut it\n(growth) short,\" Fernandez said.\n     NEDA said GNP had grown 3.56 pct and GDP 3.25 pct in the\nfourth quarter of 1986 from a year earlier. Last year's GNP\ngrowth, put earlier at 0.13 pct, was revised to 1.51 pct.\n    \"Certainly I do not see any shortage in external resources\nand if GNP growth continues at this level I would assume that\ndomestic resources on the fiscal side would be generated and\nwould not be a stumbling block,\" Fernandez said.\n    \"I think even before the figures came out, simply looking at\nkey indicators, such as consumption of fuel oil and power,\nshowed that the economy was on a different track from last\nyear,\" he said.\n    Fernandez said consumption tended to be heavier in the\nfirst and second quarters because of the dry weather, and it\ncould drop off in the third quarter.\n    He said the most significant sign of recovery lay in the\nmanufacturing sector, which grew by 9.64 pct, after declines in\n1985 and a slow turnaround in the second half of 1986.\n    \"That is not a seasonal thing, it is secular,\" he said.\n    He said the government had met all monetary targets set for\nthe first quarter in consultation with the International\nMonetary Fund (IMF). It expected to draw down the fourth\ntranche from its 198 mln SDR stand-by arrangement soon.\n    The Philippines has so far drawn three tranches totalling\n58 mln SDRs from the arrangement expiring on April 23, 1988.\nFernandez said an IMF mission would visit here in July or\nAugust to review performance in the January-June period.\n    He said IMF repayments were projected to total 1.56 billion\ndlrs over the 1987-92 period and drawings only 236 mln dlrs.\nRepayments were inevitable and many countries would find their\nnet repayments to the IMF rising in the next few years.\n    \"It means that since there will be a net drain on ODA\n(official development assistance) accounts the commercial\nbanking system will be requested to hold the line,\" he said.\n    It is an internal constraint that exists because the IMF\ndebt cannot be rescheduled, Fernandez said.\n    The Philippines rescheduled 10.3 billion dlrs of its 28\nbillion dlr foreign commercial debt in March.\n    Fernandez said Central Bank bills, introduced in March 1984\nto mop up excess liquidity, had peaked at 43.1 billion pesos in\nApril 1986. But their unwinding on maturity dates, started in\nOctober last year, had almost been completed.\n    He said auctions of treasury bills, whose outstanding level\ntouched 95.44 billion pesos on May 20, were going well.\n\"Treasury bills will remain a basic monetary tool,\" he said.\n    Commenting on the country's foreign debt Fernandez said, \"I\nthink the Philippine debt stock looms large because our own\nreceipts from exports have not taken the same kind of leap\nforward as might have been suitable.\"\n    The foreign debt is projected by the Central Bank to reach\n29.04 billion dlrs by the end of 1987.\n    NEDA said exports totalled 1.2 billion dlrs in the first\nquarter, while imports were 1.4 billion dlrs.\n    Fernandez said the government had targeted GNP growth of\nbetween six and 6.5 pct this year. He cautioned that while\ngrowth so far was high the targets had not yet been achieved.\n    Fernandez said he saw no merit in arguments by some\neconomists that the peso, currently pegged at 20.50 to the\ndollar, ought to be devalued to make the country's exports more\ncompetitive.\n    \"By being pegged to the dollar on a basket basis the peso\nhas already substantially devalued against all of the country's\ntrading partners,\" he said.\n    On the proposed Omnibus Investment Code, he said he was\nopposed to a clause which would allow the unrestricted\nrepatriation abroad of investments made during the first two\nyears after the imposition of the Code.\n    The imposition of the Code, scheduled for last January, has\nbeen delayed by objections from some business groups.\n    \"I think any central bank, certainly this one after the\nevents of the past two or two and a half years, has to be\nprudent. This is not the time to throw all caution to the winds\nand I'm not about to do that,\" Fernandez said.\n    \"It would be ideal if we reach a point where movement of\ncapital and earnings can be free,\" he said.\n    \"We have had one year of reasonably good results. Certainly\nwe continue to have a fairly heavy drain on our external\navailabilities simply by servicing our debts.\"\n REUTER\n", "Belgian industrial production, excluding\nconstruction and adjusted for seasonal and calendar influences,\nwas provisionally 0.6 pct lower in February than a year\nearlier, the National Statistics Office said.\n    Output in February was, however, 5.9 pct higher than in\nJanuary.\n    A spokeswoman for the office said the production index,\nbase 1980, rose to a provisional 108.8 in February from a\nprovisional 102.7 in January, slightly revised from the 102.8\noriginally estimated.

It is a purely technical\nmatter,\" he added.\n    The West German government is expected to come under\npressure in Venice from both the U.S. And its European partners\nto stimulate domestic demand as a way of reducing international\ntrade imbalances and contributing to world economic growth.\n    However, government officials have ruled out any further\ntax reduction packages to supplement a major program of\nstimulatory fiscal measures already underway.\n    Helmut Schlesinger, vice-president of the West German\ncentral bank, the Bundesbank, said in Tokyo today that GNP, the\nwidest measure of a country's economic activity, fell in real\nterms by a seasonally adjusted 1/2 to one pct in the first\nquarter compared with the fourth 1986 period.\n     The government has confirmed that growth was negative in\nthe first 1987 quarter. But year-on-year growth is expected to\nbe about two pct.\n    Schlesinger today repeated the Bundesbank's reluctance to\ncut its official interest rates further. Its key discount rate,\nat three pct, is just above historical lows.\n    West German officials are likely to emphasise at the Venice\nsummit that domestic demand, which draws in goods from abroad,\nis already outstripping export performance, which has suffered\nfrom an 80 pct rise of the mark against the dollar in just over\ntwo years.\n    The government has pointed out that depressed exports are\nthe main reason for the current weakness in the economy, but\nsays that later in the year stronger domestic demand will\ncompensate for this setback.\n    It expects GNP growth for the whole of 1987 of just under\ntwo pct, after a 2.4 pct rise in 1986.\n REUTER\n", "For currency dealers Karl Otto Poehl is\nthe scourge of speculators, for bankers he is the man who has\nplayed a key role in shaping the world's financial destiny for\nthe last seven years, and for Germans he is the guardian of the\nmark.\n    President of the powerful and independent West German\ncentral bank, the Bundesbank, Poehl is likely to have his\ncontract renewed for another eight years when it expires at the\nend of this year, government officials say.\n    (Index of economic spotlights, see page ECRA)\n    But no official announcement has yet been made, raising\neyebrows in West Germany's business community.\n    The ebullient Poehl spent seven years in Bonn in top\nministerial posts under the Social Democrats, now in\nopposition, before he moved to the Bundesbank.\n    There has been speculation that Chancellor Helmut Kohl\nwould try to replace Poehl with a man closer to his own\nChristian Democrats. But officials noted that Poehl has worked\nclosely and successfully with Finance Minister Gerhard\nStoltenberg since Kohl's government took office in 1982.\n    Poehl, the most senior central banker apart from Paul\nVolcker of the United States, enjoys a strong international\nreputation which it would take a newcomer years to build up.\n    Given these circumstances, Kohl will probably overlook\nPoehl's past as an adviser to former Social Democrat Chancellor\nWilly Brandt, and top aide to Helmut Schmidt when he was\nFinance Minister, bankers said. It was Schmidt who, as\nChancellor, appointed Poehl to his present job in 1980.\n    In recent months, with the mark's strong rise against the\ndollar, Poehl has made exchange rates the central concern of\nthe Bundesbank's council, a highly conservative institution\nwhich has doggedly pursued monetary policies to prevent\ninflation catching hold. Older Germans can remember two bouts\nof galloping inflation this century.\n    But with consumer prices falling for much of 1986, and\ninflation negligible so far this year, Poehl thinks it is safe\nto relax the monetary reins a little and concentrate on the\ndangers to the German economy of a bloated exchange rate.\n    \"I am of the opinion that efforts to stabilise the\ndollar/mark rate have reached a high priority, also for the\nBundesbank, because a further massive revaluation of the mark\nwould endanger the economy in West Germany,\" he told business\njournalists in Frankfurt recently.\n    Ute Geipel, head of research at Citibank AG, says that\nPoehl's reappointment would guarantee flexible monetary policy.\n    \"Poehl's policy has always been a policy which does not\nfocus so rigidly on domestic factors, but also on the external\neconomy,\" she said.\n    An economist at a German bank, who declined to be\nidentified, said \"If Poehl is confirmed in his post, it will\ncertainly be a plus for the pragmatic course which is not so\nrigidly oriented towards money supply.\"\n    One of Poehl's great struggles recently has been to\npersuade the United States to stop \"talking down\" the dollar. For\nPoehl, the significance of the February Louvre Accord was that\nthe United States agreed to join efforts to stabilise\ncurrencies.\n    The Louvre Accord was greeted with scepticism by currency\ndealers who said they would soon put it to the test. But in\nfact the dollar has been relatively stable since the pact.\n    \"This is because the markets know - or perhaps because they\ndon't know - what the central banks can do,\" Poehl says of\nintervention in currency markets which can quickly turn rates\nround, making a speculator's position worthless.\n    Poehl was born in 1929 and worked as a financial journalist\nin the 1960s before starting his ministerial career.\n    A relaxed sun-tanned figure who enjoys cracking jokes over\na glass of beer, he is hardly a stereotype central banker.\n    He is also a keen sportsman who likes to watch football and\nplay golf.\n    Poehl says currency market intervention cannot substitute\nfor correct economic policies if exchange rates are imbalanced.\n    \"But you can achieve an enormous effect with a small amount\nif you strike at the right moment,\" he said. Bundesbank dealers\nare very professional and skilled. \"They've burnt the fingers of\nmany people,\" he said. And unlike the speculators, Poehl notes,\nthe Bundesbank dealers usually make a profit.\n REUTER\n", "Finland's current account balance of\npayments showed a deficit of 2.5 billion markka in first\nquarter 1987 against a deficit of 3.2 billion in the same\nperiod last year, the Bank of Finland said in a statement.\n REUTER\n", "Taiwan's central bank announced that as\nfrom today the overseas foreign exchange borrowings of local\nand foreign banks would be frozen at the level they reached at\nthe end of May.\n    The central bank's statement added that the measure would\nbe effective until the end of July.\n    Bankers said the measure is designed to curb the inflow of\nforeign exchange and slow the growth of money supply.

U.S. Lenders,\nmostly savings and loan associations, were earning rates as low\nas three pct on 30 year fixed rate mortgages they held in their\nportfolios but had to pay depositors rates as high as 15 pct to\ninduce them to retain their accounts.\n    As a result hundreds of institutions collapsed or were\nforced to merge.

He\nsaid money market rates were too high to arrange both the\nmortgages and hedge profitably.\n    However, he said that when the Household Mortgage Co does\nmake fixed rate mortgages it is likely to securitise them. This\nmeans bundling different mortgages together to resemble a bond\nand selling them to an investor.\n    For technical reasons securitisation is simpler and more\nefficient with fixed rate rather than with floating rate\nmortgages.
