This winter, however,\nsnowcover in Soviet grain areas has generally been excellent,\nso the bulk of winterkill, analysts speculate, likely has been\ndue to a very dry fall and subsequent poor crop germination.\n    \"Fall dryness may be a problem. There's a good correlation\nbetween mediocre crops and fall dryness,\" Martell said.\n    Precipitation last fall was as little as 25 pct of normal\nin southern and northern Ukraine, and below normal over the\nentire winter crop area, she said.\n    Recent cold temperatures in grain areas in which the\nsnowcover has been gradually melting could also have caused \nproblems of ice-crusting and winterkill, Jim Candor, senior\nforecaster for Accu Weather, said.\n    Livestock feed needs have probably increased because of the\nfall and winter, analysts said.

But it\nis also likely that such assistance would be provided to\nNigeria which is under pressure to extend discounts.\n    Analysts said that Saudi Arabia, with assistance from OPEC\npresident Rilwanu Lukman, was trying to avoid an emergency OPEC\nmeeting for fear that it would give the appearance that the\nDecember pact is falling apart.\n    Daniel McKinley, oil analyst with Smith Barney, Upham\nHarris and Co said, \"both physical and futures markets have been\noversold and it only took a small spark to bring on a short\ncovering rally.\"\n    He believes an Iranian trade mission to Tokyo, which\nrefused discounts to Japanese buyers, brought Japanese refiners\ninto the market to cover their short positions.\n    Oil traders said one japanese refiner came into the market\nto but 10 cargoes of May Dubai, which sent prices up on Mideast\nsours, with Dubai trading up to 16.50 dlrs after trading\nyeterray as low as 15.63 dlrs and then spilled over into the\nNorth sea crude oil market.\n    Traders said that there have been persistent rumors today\nthat Japanese buyers are looking to pick up cargoes of Brent\nfor Japan and European trade sources indidate rumors of vessels\nbeing fixed to make such shipments.\n    North sea brent today rose over 17.00 dlrs with trades\nreported as high as 17.05 dlrs, up one dlr.\n    OPEC members' denials that they are producing over their\nquotas sparked moves to cover short postitions.\n    Indonesian oil minister Subroto said today that OPEC\nproduction was below the 15.8 mln bpd quota agreed to last\ndecember but he gave no details on OPEC production against\nclaims it was more at least one mln bpd above that level.\n    \"The production probably is about their quota level and\nlargely because Saudi Arabia will not discount and canot sell\nits oil as a result,\" Margoshes said.\n    Analysts have mixed opinions about the extent of the\ncurrent rally. Some believe prices can continue to rise if\nSaudi Arabia and OPEC hold steady in a refusal to discount.\n    But others said that despite the rally today there were\nstill several fundamental factors, including demand, which\ncould cut the rally short.\n    Marion Stewart, an indepedent petroleum economist, said\nslow growth in the economies of the U.S. and OECD would keep\ndemand for oil slack and he now estimates that demand to rise\nabout 1.4 pct over 1986.\n Reuter\n", "Coffee prices may have to fall even lower\nto bring exporting and importing countries once more round the\nnegotiating table to discuss export quotas, ICO delegates and\ntraders said.\n    The failure last night of International Coffee\nOrganization, ICO, producing and consuming countries to agree\nexport quotas brought a sharp fall on international coffee\nfutures markets today with the London May price reaching a\n4-1/2 year low at one stage of 1,270 stg per tonne before\nending the day at 1,314 stg, down 184 stg from the previous\nclose.\n    The New York May price was down 15.59 at 108.00 cents a lb.\n    Pressure will now build up on producers returning from the\nICO talks to sell coffee which had been held back in the hope\nthe negotiations would establish quotas which would put a floor\nunder prices, some senior traders said.\n    The ICO 15 day average price stood at 114.66 cents a lb for\nMarch 2. This compares with a target range of 120 to 140 cents\na lb under the system operating before quotas were suspended in\nFebruary last year following a sharp rise in international\nprices caused by drought damage to the Brazilian crop.\n    In a Reuter interview, Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC,\nPresident Jorio Dauster urged producers not to panic and said\nthey need to make hard commercial decisions. \"If we have failed\nat the ICO, at least we have tried,\" Dauster said, adding \"now it\nis time to go and sell coffee.\"\n    But Brazil is keeping its marketing options open. It plans\nto make an official estimate of the forthcoming crop next\nmonth, Dauster said. It is too difficult to forecast now. Trade\nsources have put the crop at over 26 mln bags compared with a\nprevious crop of 11.2 mln. Brazil is defining details of public\nselling tenders for coffee bought on London's futures market\nlast year.\n    A basic condition will be that it does not go back to the\nmarket \"in one go\" but is sold over a minimum of six months.\n    The breakdown of the ICO negotiations reflected a split\nbetween producers and consumers on how to set the yardstick for\nfuture quotas. Consumers said \"objective criteria\" like average\nexports and stocks should determine producer quota shares,\nDauster said.\n    All elements of this proposal were open to negotiation but\nconsumers insisted they did not want a return to the \"ad hoc\" way\nof settling export quotas by virtual horse trading amongst\nproducers whilst consumers waited in the corridors of the ICO.\n    Dauster said stocks and exports to ICO members and\nnon-members all need to be considered when setting quotas and\nthat Brazil would like to apply the coffee pact with a set\nratio of overall quota reflecting stock holdings.\n    It is a \"simplistic misconception that Brazil can dictate\"\npolicy to other producers. While consumer countries are welcome\nto participate they cannot dictate quotas which are very\ndifficult to allocate as different \"objective criteria\" achieve\ndifferent share-outs of quota, Dauster said.\n    Other delegates said there was more open talking at the ICO\nand at least differences were not hidden by a bad compromise.\n    Consumer delegates said they had not been prepared to\naccept the producers' offer to abandon quotas if it proves\nimpossible to find an acceptable basis for them.\n    \"We want the basis of quotas to reflect availability and to\nencourage stock holding as an alternative to a buffer stock if\nsupplies are needed at a later stage,\" one delegate said.\n    Some consumers claimed producer support for the consumer\nargument was gaining momentum towards the end of the ICO\nsession but said it is uncertain whether this will now collapse\nand how much producers will sink their differences should\nprices fall further and remain depressed.\n    The ICO executive board meets here March 30 to April 1 but\nboth producer and consumer delegates said they doubt if real\nnegotiations will begin then. The board is due to meet in\nIndonesia in June with a full council scheduled for September.\n    More cynical traders said the pressure of market forces and\npolitics in debt heavy Latin American producer countries could\nbring ICO members back around the negotiating table sooner than\nmany imagine. In that case quotas could come into force during\nthe summer. But most delegates and traders said quotas before\nOctober are unlikely, while Brazil's Dauster noted the ICO has\ncontinued although there were no quotas from 1972 to 1980.\n    A clear difference between the pressures already being felt\nby importers and exporters was that consumers would have been\nhappy to agree on a formula for future quotas even if it could\nnot be imposed now. At least in that way they said they could\nshow a direct relationship between quotas and availability.\n    In contrast producers wanted stop-gap quotas to plug the\nseemingly bottomless market and were prepared to allow these to\nlapse should lasting agreement not be found.\n    \"Producers were offering us jam tomorrow but after their\nfailure to discuss them last year promises were insufficient\nand we wanted a cast iron commitment now,\" one consumer said.\n Reuter\n", "Alcan Aluminium Ltd is closing its\naluminum smelter in Ludwigshafen, West Germany this June due to\nhigh operating costs, an Alcan spokesman said.\n    The smelter, near Frankfurt, had annual capacity of about\n44,000 tonnes but was operating at about half that in January,\nspokesman Fernand Leclerc said.\n    Leclerc said Alcan decided it would cost too much to\nmodernize the plant.\n    He said there is a possibility the company will sell the\nsmelter, which currently employs 320 people, before its\nscheduled closing.\n Reuter\n", "<PanCanadian Petroleum Ltd>\nsaid it agreed to sell its working interest in its North Sea\nproperties and its British unit, Canadian Pacific Oil and Gas\nof Canada Ltd, to Whitehall Petroleum Ltd, a private British\ncompany.\n    PanCanadian, 87 pct-owned by Canadian Pacific Ltd <CP>,\nsaid it would receive 1.7 mln British pounds cash (3.5 mln\nCanadian dlrs) at closing, expected in two to three months.\n    It said the deal is subject to approval by regulators and\nits partners in the properties, which consist of exploration\nwells.

But critics have\nbeen warning for years that the constant exposure to the drugs\nis helping bacteria learn to resist the drugs.\n    Industry officials have disputed this, saying the diseases\nthat develop a resistance in cattle probably do not affect\nhumans.\n    But the new study, reported in Thursday's New England\nJournal of Medicine, shows the diseases can spread to humans.\n    The research team, led by Dr. John Spika, said the number\nof people who have developed the chloramphenicol-resistant\ninfection in Los Angeles County alone jumped from 69 in 1984 to\n298 the following year. Two of those victims died and half the\nvictims in their study of 45 patients had to be hospitalized\nfor their illness.\n    They also discovered that cooking the meat didn't always\nprevent the disease. Only 15 pct of the victims reported eating\nraw, infected hamburger.

However, the sources noted\na late temporao is always more susceptible to pod rot, which\nflourishes if conditions turn cold and humid, and which is more\nlikely from late July on.\n    This year's crop is doubly susceptible because poor prices\nmean farmers were not encouraged to invest in fertilisers and\ninsecticides and are also unlikely to treat against pod rot.\n    A severe attack of pod rot can cause the loss of over\n500,000 bags in a very short period, one source said.\n    Because of the increased exposure to pod rot damage,\nestimates of the final outcome of the temporao are extremely\nvulnerable and production could easily drop to below the 2.0\nmln bag mark if the disease hits.\n    Although flowering was good following the start of the\nrains, pod setting was not up to expectations, possibly because\nthe drought had caused a drop in the insect population which\npollinates flowers, the sources said.\n    However, reports from farms indicate moisture levels are\nnow generally back to near normal levels and that current\nflowering and pod setting is good, which should result in\nmature fruit from August through September.\n    The sources said they expect no break in the harvesting of\nbeans between the end of the temporao and the beginning of the\nmain crop, which officially starts on October 1.\n    \"The cut-off date is completely artificial.

O. Licht.\n    Areas may be slightly lower but analysts and agricultural\nexperts said the steady rise in yields resulting from improved\nseed varieties and better farming techniques could offset this.\nIn recent years, good autumn weather has given yields a late\nboost, making up for lower areas despite some disappointing\nstarts to growing seasons.\n    Changes in EC areas reflect the extent to which producers\nwill grow so-called \"C\" sugar for unsubsidised sale to the world\nmarket. This is what is produced in excess of the basic area\nneeded to meet the EC \"A\" and \"B\" quotas, which receive full and\npartial price support, respectively.\n    Some analysts said the open row that broke out last week\nbetween producers and the EC commission over its export policy\ncould have serious implications for future sugar output.\n    Beet producers have threatened to effectively dump nearly\none mln tonnes of white sugar into EC intervention stocks as\nthey feel export subsidies have been too low to compensate for\nthe gap between high EC internal and low world market prices.\n    However, with the EC budget stretched to breaking point,\nthis could give treasury ministers extra resolve in resisting\nhigher guaranteed sugar prices and build a case for a future\ncut in the basic \"A\" and \"B\" quotas, they added.\n    In France, the largest producer of EC quota and non quota\nsugar, the sugar market intervention board FIRS said first\nplanting intentions indicate an area about the same as last\nyear's 421,000 hectares, nine pct below the previous year.\n    \"The basic trend is towards stability,\" a FIRS spokesman\nsaid.

World prices are still below Polish\nproduction costs and there is no way to convince farmers to\nincrease the area above the already signed contracted level.\n    The national plan, set before prices began to rise, put\nplantings this year at 460,000 hectares, against 425,000 in\n1986, Nowicki said.

One consumer country delegate said this would\n\"distort, not support\" the market.\n    Trade and industry sources blame uncertainty about the ICCO\nfor destabilising the market as the recent collapse in coffee\nprices has made traders acutely aware that commodity pacts can\nfounder. On Friday this uncertainty helped push London cocoa\nfutures down to eight month lows. The strength of sterling has\nalso contributed to the recent slip in prices.\n    The ICCO daily and average prices on Friday fell below the\n\"must buy\" level of 1,600 SDRs a tonne designated in the pact,\nwhich came into force at the last ICCO session in January but\nwithout rules for the operation of the buffer stock.\n    Consumers and producers could not agree on how it should\noperate and what discretion it should be given. The agreement\nlimits it to trading physical cocoa and expressly says it\ncannot operate on futures markets.\n    A cash balance of some 250 mln dlrs and a stock of almost\n100,000 tonnes of cocoa, enough to mount large buying or\nselling operations, were carried forward from the previous\nagreement.\n    Members finance the stock through a 45 dlrs a tonne levy on\nall cocoa they trade. It has an upper limit of 250,000 tonnes.\n    The key arguments being faced by the ICCO working group on\nbuffer stock rules which is meeting today and tomorrow will be\nover non-member cocoa and differentials the buffer stock should\npay when trading different types of cocoa. Another working\ngroup is scheduled to meet Wednesday to discuss administrative\nmatters, and the full council meets on Thursday.\n    Producers have so far maintained that buffer stock funds\nshould not help mop up surplus cocoa produced in non-member\ncountries such as Malaysia.\n    Consumers say when this cocoa is the cheapest the buffer\nstock should buy it rather than compete with chocolate\nmanufacturers for premium-priced high quality cocoas.\n    The argument over buying non-member cocoa is closely linked\nto the one over differentials for different qualities.\n    European industry and trade advisers have suggested as a\ncompromise that the buffer stock have a maximum share that can\nrepresent non-member cocoa and that it use the London futures\nmarket's existing differentials for different qualities.\n    Currently, good West African cocoa is tendered at par onto\nthe London market.\n    Discounts, which are currently under review, range up to 50\nstg a tonne for Brazilian and Malaysian cocoa.\n    Consumer delegates said the same arguments in reverse would\noperate when prices are high - the buffer stock should sell the\nhighest priced cocoa in most demand, forcing all prices lower.\n    The January talks were slowed by a split inside the\nEuropean Community, a key ICCO consumer group, with France\nsiding with producers. EC representatives met in closed session\nin Brussels on Friday in an attempt to reach a common ground\nand, a diplomatic source said, narrowed the range of positions\namong the 12 nations.\n    The source said the EC will be looking for signs of\nflexibility on the part of producers in the next few days and\nwill be able to respond if they are there.\n    One ICCO delegate describing the producer/consumer split\nsaid consumer proposals mean buying more cocoa for less and\nbacks the concept of the pact which is \"meant to support the\nmarket where trade buying is not.\"\n    In contrast, he said, producers seem to want to sell their\ncocoa to the buffer stock rather than consumers.\n    Other, more technical, issues still outstanding include\nwhether the buffer stock should buy at a single announced\n\"posted price\" as in the previous pact or by announcing it is\nbuying then accepting offers.\n    In either case, delegates said, it is accepted that\nproducers must be given a clear opportunity to make offers of\ncocoa for forward shipment directly to the buffer stock in a\nway that is competitive with spot offers made by dealers.\n REUTER\n", "President Leon Febres Cordero said\nEcuador would honour its debt when it had the capacity to make\npayments, but said foreign banks had calculated oil would have\nto be 25 dlrs a barrel for Ecuador to meet its commitments.\n    Ecuador said on Friday that last week's earthquake was\nforcing it to reaffirm an earlier decision -- based on the\nslide in world oil prices -- to suspend debt payments to\nprivate foreign banks, which hold two-thirds of its 8.16\nbillion dlr foreign debt.\n    \"All legitimate debt is a commitment of honour,\" the\npresident said during a visit to the quake zone. \"A government\nas a sovereign entity has dignity and prestige to maintain.\"\n    Private foreign banks and the World Bank had calculated oil\nwould have to be at least 25 dlrs a barrel for Quito to be able\nto meet its commitments, Febres Cordero said.\n    He added that Ecuadorean crude was now selling for 15 to 17\ndlrs a barrel after having been sold for many months at 12 dlrs\na barrel and as low as seven dlrs before that.\n    Meanwhile, Ecuador announced an austerity program and a\nprice freeze on key consumer goods as a result of the\nearthquake, which killed at least 300 people.\n    Presidency Minister Patricio Quevedo said the budget would\nbe cut by five to 10 pct, government hiring would be frozen and\nsalaries of top officials, including the president and cabinet,\nwould be reduced.\n    He also said a price freeze would be imposed on 20 basic\nconsumer items, mainly food staples, while the price of\ngasoline would rise by between 69 and 80 pct and bus fares\nwould rise by 20 pct.

It is being played\nby OPEC membership as a whole because the reduction in the 15.8\nmln bpd share of OPEC in the market is being shared by other\nmembers of OPEC,\" Nazer said.\n    Nazer said OPEC estimated demand for its oil during third\nquarter this year would be around 16.6 mln bpd.\n    But he said if circumstances changed \"I am sure then the\nOPEC members will consult with each other and take the\nnecessary measures.\"\n    Oil analysts say the OPEC pact could come under strain when\ndemand for petroleum products generally falls in the northern\nhemisphere spring and summer.\n    Nazer said he was satisfied with the extent of cooperation\nfrom non-OPEC producers. Norway, Egypt and the Soviet Union\nagreed to help OPEC by restraining production or exports after\nhe visited them on OPEC's behalf earlier this year.\n    \"We did not ask any country to do anything.

A\nyear earlier, they had produced and exported about 800,000\nmore, according to the London-based International Sugar\nOrganization.\n    Years of continuous low prices have plunged the sugar\nindustry in many countries in the region into a recession from\nwhich it will be hard to recover.\n    Miguel Guerrero, director of the Dominican Republic's\nNational Sugar Institute, said it would be difficult to boost\nproduction even if prices recovered sharply.\n    Output had slumped to under 450,000 tonnes a year from\n900,000 in the late 1970s. Obsolete refineries, poor transport\nand badly maintained plantations were barriers to any short\nterm recovery in output, he added.\n    Plans of nearby Cuba, the world's largest cane sugar\nexporter, to increase output to 10 mln tonnes a year by the end\nof the decade seem ambitious, trade sources said. Output is\nrunning well below the record 8.6 mln produced in 1970.\n    Cuba suffers from run down plantations, harvesting problems\nand poor processing facilities more than from low world prices,\nsince much of its output is sold to Eastern Bloc countries\nunder special deals. Last year, bad weather added to its\ntroubles, and output fell to 7.2 mln tonnes from 8.2 mln in\n1985.\n    The low world prices of recent years have led many\ncountries in the region to cut exportable production to levels\nwhere they barely cover U.S. And, in the case of some Caribbean\ncountries, European Community (EC) import quotas, for which\nthey receive prices well above free market levels.\n    Progressive reductions in the U.S. Quotas have led to\nproduction stagnating or falling rather than being shifted to\nthe free world market.\n    Peru, for example, shipped 96,000 tonnes to the U.S. In\nboth 1983 and 1984. This fell to 76,000 in 1986 and this year\nits quota is only 37,000.\n    A national cooperative official said that, as long as world\nmarket levels continue at around half of Peru's production\ncost, the future of the industry is uncertain.\n    At a meeting of GEPLACEA in Brazil last October officials\nstressed the need to find alternative uses for sugar cane\nwhich, according to the group's executive-secretary Eduardo\nLatorre, \"grows like a weed\" throughout the region.\n    Brazil, the largest cane producer with output of around 240\nmln tonnes, uses over half to produce alcohol fuel. Cane in\nexcess of internal demand for alcohol and sugar is refined into\nsugar for sale abroad to earn much needed foreign currency.\n    The difference in the price the state-run Sugar and Alcohol\nInstitute (IAA) pays local industry and what it receives from\nforeign buyers costs the government some 350 mln dlrs a year.\n    Soaring domestic demand for both alcohol and sugar over the\npast year, coupled with a drought-reduced cane crop, has meant\nBrazil will have difficulties in meeting export commitments in\n1987, trade sources said. Negotiations to delay shipments to\nnext year have been indecisive so far, the main sticking point\nbeing how Brazil should compensate buyers for non-delivery of\nsugar it had sold at around five cents per lb and which would\ncost eight cents to replace.\n    Brazilian sugar industry sources said new sugar export\nsales were expected to be extremely low for the next year, with\nthe Institute wary of exposing itself to domestic shortages of\neither alcohol or sugar and because of the need to rebuild\ndepleted reserve stockpiles.\n    However, the situation could change dramatically if the\neconomy goes into recession and internal demand slumps.\n    Sources within Latin America and the Caribbean hold little\nhope for the region's sugar industry to return to profitability\nunless the U.S. And EC change their policies.\n    \"The agricultural policies of the European Community and of\nthe United States have caused our economies incalculable harm\nby closing their markets, by price deterioration in\ninternational commerce and furthermore by the unfair\ncompetition in third countries,\" Brazil's Trade and Industry\nMinister Jose Hugo Castelo Branco told the October GEPLACEA\nmeeting.\n    The EC has come under prolonged attack from GEPLACEA for\nwhat the group charges is its continued dumping of excess\noutput on world markets.

Taken together, the four\nAmerican-led warrant issues raised only about 50 mln Swiss\nfrancs.\n    But banks believe the vehicle meets a need of investors and\npredicted a lively future.\n    Andrew Barrett of Citicorp Investment Bank (Switzerland) AG\nsaid: \"The warrants give smaller investors a chance to have a\nlong-term investment in gold with limited risk.\"\n    Citicorp in Zurich launched the first of these warrants on\nFebruary 27, following it up with a second issue less than a\nweek later. The issuer in both cases was Citibank NA.\n    The idea found some quick copies. Goldman Sachs in Zurich\norganized and co-led an issue for the Swiss branch of Banque\nIndosuez on March 9 and last night Morgan Guaranty\n(Switzerland) AG did another for Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of\nNew York.\n    The four issues now offer investors striking prices for\ngold ranging from the Indosuez issue at 410 dlrs an ounce, the\nsame price as the underlying commodity, to a 430 dlr level on\nthe first one for Citibank.\n    The premiums range from 22 pct to 36 pct and maturities\nfrom 18 months to four years and three months, in all cases\nlonger than gold futures and options on U.S. Markets.\n    The bankers traced the inspiration for the market back to\nthe February report of U.S. Consumer prices for January, when a\njump of 0.7 pct raised again the threat of inflation.\n    \"Many people are worried about inflation again,\" said Mats\nJoensson of Goldman Sachs. \"Money supply in Germany and the\nUnited States has grown very strongly in the last year and\npeople want to take a ride on gold.\"\n    The gold market, having seen strong gains in 1986, has\nlanguished just above 400 dlrs an ounce over the past few\nweeks. But the banks saw in warrants the vehicle for a more\nhighly leveraged play where the downside risk was limited.\n    Barrett said it was natural that the market developed in\nSwitzerland. \"People here understand gold, and they understand\nwarrants,\" he said.\n    Citicorp (Switzerland) pioneered warrants with a series of\nequity-linked covered issues based on Japanese company shares\nover the past two years, and last autumn, Swiss banks launched\ncovered warrants in Swiss registered shares in a bid to give\nforeign investors a chance to play in a market otherwise closed\nto all but Swiss citizens, and to play it with higher leverage.\n    But after a quick flurry of issues, that market dried up\nwhen Swiss shares prices fell from their January peaks.\n    The issues are being marketed not on the basis of simple\npremiums, but on implicit volatility models devised to provide\nscientific comparisons between titles in the options market.\n    Martin Bachem of Morgan Guaranty said his bank's issue was\ncompetitive despite its relatively high premium. The issue, for\nfive ounces at 425 dlrs, was priced at 955 Swiss francs, making\na premium over the spot gold price of nearly 36 pct.\n    Using a Black Sholes options model, he said the issue's\nlong, 4.3-year maturity meant the warrants needed an implicit\nvolatility of gold of only 24.5 pct for the option to pay off,\nwhich he claimed was lower than the other issues.\n    But Barrett said the Black Sholes variant Citicorp used\npointed to a higher volatily for the Morgan issue and\nemphasized that the models were at best an inexact science.\n    And each bank, using its own model, put the implicit\nvolatility needed for its own issue at close to 25 pct.\n    Whatever the calculation, the issues have received a warm\nwelcome from investors.\n    Joensson of Goldman Sachs said there was a lot of demand,\neven among small investors, who were buying 15 or 20 warrants\napiece. \"The most sophisticated ones wouldn't buy these because\nthe premiums are too high,\" he said.\n REUTER\n", "Energy Secretary John Herrington\nsaid his proposed option to raise the oil depletion allowance\nto 27.5 pct was probably the most economically promising way to\nspur domestic production.\n    The White House has said it would consider the option\nalthough it was generally opposed to any revisions in the new\ntax code.\n    Herrington told a meeting of the Mid-Continent Oil and Gas\nAssociation that the higher depletion allowance on new oil and\nenhanced oil recovery would cost taxpayers about 200 mln dlrs a\nyear.\n    The option was one of many contained in a report on oil and\nthe national security the Energy Department sent to the White\nHouse on Tuesday.\n    Herrington said of the increased depletion allowance\noption: \"that is one that could significantly increase\nproduction at a very low cost to the American taxpayer.\"\n    He again rejected an oil import fee as far too costly to\nthe overall U.S. economy.\n Reuter\n", "Zimbabwe's projected coffee output of\n13,000 tonnes for 1987/88 could be reduced by drought, growers\nsaid.\n    The main coffee growing areas in eastern Zimbabwe have\nreceived little rain since April 1986 and the Coffee Growers'\nAssociation has begun a survey to assess the effects of the\ndrought, a spokesman said.\n    Zimbabwe exported 11,000 tonnes of coffee in 1986, mainly\nto West Germany, Britain, Japan, the Netherlands, Switzerland\nand the United States.\n Reuter\n", "An accord is in sight in Brazil's\n20-day-old national seamen's strike, which has seriously\ndelayed exports, a union official said.\n    The official, speaking from strike headquarters in Rio de\nJaneiro, said up to 30,000 of Brazil's 40,000 seamen were still\non strike.\n    He said the others had returned to work over the last week,\naccepting pay offers of 120 pct from four private companies and\nfrom the Frota Nacional de Petroleiros (Fronape), part of the\nstate-owned oil company Petrobras.\n    The association grouping private shipowners, Syndarma, has\nalso offered 120 pct but talks have so far been deadlocked over\npayment for overtime.\n    The union official said he believed this issue would be\nresolved shortly.\n Reuter\n", "Colombia will not attend a meeting of\ncoffee producing countries scheduled for this weekend in\nNicaragua, Jorge Cadenas, manager of the National Coffee\nGrowers' Federation, said.\n    \"We prefer to wait until things are better prepared,\" he told\nReuters.

The buffer stock remains the sole\ninstrument of market intervention for price stabilisation and\nits maximum capacity is unchanged at 550,000 tonnes, Xuto\nadded.\n    At this month's session, which was the fourth attempt in\ntwo years to negotiate a new INRA, the main issue to be\nresolved concerned the mechanism for adjusting the reference\nprice.\n    It was agreed to conduct reviews of the reference price\nevery 15 months -- instead of the current 18-month intervals.\n    The extent of the adjustment was also modified.\n    Under the present agreement if the daily market indicator\nprice has been above the upper intervention (\"may sell\") price\n(currently 231 Malaysian/Singapore cents) or below the lower\nintervention price (\"may buy\") price (171 cents at present) for\nsix months, the reference price is then revised by five pct or\nwhatever amount the International Natural Rubber Council\ndecides.\n    Under the new pact, the adjustment under these\ncircumstances will be five pct unless the Council decides on a\nhigher adjustment.\n    Similarly, when buffer stock purchases or sales amount to\n300,000 tonnes, there would be an automatic adjustment of three\npct under the new accord unless the Council decides on a higher\npercentage.\n    Throughout the talks, which began on March 9, producers had\nstrongly opposed a consumer proposal to lower the reference\nprice and the \"lower indicative price\" (or floor price) of 150\ncents in the present pact if the buffer stock, currently\n360,000 tonnes, reached 450,000 tonnes.\n    The proposal, initiated by the U.S., was withdrawn last\nFriday, setting the stage for compromise at the weekend.\n    Since then negotiators have worked on the finer details of\nthe new pact.\n    On the question of conditions for entry into force of the\nnew INRA, Xuto said it was tentatively agreed that governments\naccounting for 75 pct of world exports and 75 pct of world\nimports approved or ratified the new agreement before it became\noperational.\n    The present agreement had a figure of 80 pct.\n Reuter\n", "Sugar which EC producers plan to sell\ninto intervention may be offered by the European Commission for\nsale within the Community, broker C. Czarnikow says in its\nlatest sugar review.\n    The Commission will propose to offer the sugar at a very\nnominal premium of 0.01 European Currency Unit (Ecu) to the\nintervention price, with detrimental consequences for\nproducers' returns, Czarnikow says. The move is seen as an\nattempt to persuade the producers to take back the surrendered\nsugar.\n    The Commission may also take other steps to dissuade\nproducers from their chosen course, such as removing the time\nlimit on storage contracts, which presently means that\nintervention stocks have to be removed by the end of September,\nCzarnikow says. There is also the possibility of production\nquotas being reduced.\n    If the Commission decided to offer the sugar to traders for\nexport, the restitutions would have to be higher than those at\nrecent export tenders, Czarnikow notes. To match the difference\nbetween the EC price and the world market price, the extra\ncosts might be as much as 20 Ecus per tonne, it says.\n    The producers might have to repay these costs through\nproduction levies and the proposed special elimination levy,\nCzarnikow says, but it would be several months before any costs\ncould be recovered under EC rules.\n    The primary cause of the plan to sell 775,000 tonnes of\nsugar into intervention in France is dissatisfaction with the\nEC export program as the restitution has increasingly failed to\nbridge the gap between the EC price and the world market price,\nCzarnikow notes. The French move is thus seen as a form of\nprotest designed to force the Commission's hand.\n    In West Germany, 79,250 tonnes have been tendered for\nintervention, but Czarnikow says the motive here is to ensure\nthat the 1986/87 price is paid for sugar that was produced in\n1986.

It is restricted to new offshore developments\noutside the southern basin and yet to gain Annex B approval.\n    A report by the stockbrokers said that on a new field not\npaying PRT due to its small size, the relief would directly\nbenefit in PRT saving on an existing field.\n    \"The cross field allowance will mainly benefit participators\nin those fields which have no PRT liability,\" the report said,\nadding that the timing of development of such fields may be\nadvanced.\n    The government would in effect be subsidising these\ndevelopments at 7.5 pct of capital expenditure before\ncorporation tax, the report said.\n    On fields likely to pay PRT in the future, the benefit is\nof timing. Although liabilities on other existing fields will\nbe reduced immediately, liabilities on larger new fields will\nrise in the future due to the loss of offsets, it said.\n    In a study on probable fields, the report said that when\nthe rates of return are examined, the rise for a PRT-paying\nfield such as Miller, the largest undeveloped oil field in the\nU.K. North Sea, is from 18.7 to 19 pct, while the rise for a\nsmall non-PRT paying field such as Kittiwake is 15.9 to 17.9\npct.\n    The report added that in fields which pay PRT, there will\nbe a cost in being able to have this early relief. Not only\nwill these costs be unavailable for offset against the field's\nfuture profits, but uplift of some 35 pct on these costs will\nbe lost.\n    Thus, a saving of PRT of 100 when field development starts\nwill have to be matched by a rise in PRT of 135 at a later\ntime.\n Reuter\n", "There is no confirmation\nthat Brazil's major processors of Frozen Concentrated Orange\nJuice, FCOJ, will raise export prices of the product to 1,375\ndlrs per tonne from April 1, a spokesman for the Brazilian\nAssociation of Citrus Juice Industries (Abrassuco) said.\n    Asked to comment on a report from New York that Cutrale and\nCitrosuco had sent telexes to customers informing of the price\nraise, Jose Carlos Goncalves said Abrassuco was not aware of\nit.\n    \"All we know is that Cacex has increased the dollar amount\nto translate FOB price to ex-dock New York price to 1,050 dlrs\nfrom 770 dlrs,\" Goncalves said.\n    Citrosuco and Cutrale officials were not available for\ncomment.\n Reuter\n", "An additional margin of 1,000 dlrs\nwill be required on all July 1987 delivery coffee \"C\" contracts\nas of the opening of trade Monday, March 23, the Coffee, Sugar\nand Cocoa Exchange, CSCE, said.\n    The March contract ends trading this week, making May and\nJuly the two \"spot,\" or unlimited, contract months next week.\n    Members will then have to obtain a minimum 3,500 dlrs for\nnet long or net short positions in the May and July contracts,\nincluding a 2,500 original margin plus the additional 1,000 dlr\nspot charge.\n Reuter\n", "This weekend's meeting of Latin\nAmerican coffee producers here will call for the International\nCoffee Organisation (ICO) to start talks aimed at firming\nprices, Nicaraguan foreign trade minister Alejandro Martinez\nCuenca said.\n    He said those countries which had confirmed their presence\nwere Brazil, Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica and\nPanama.

The accord provided for a stand-by loan, a compensatory\nfinancing facility and a structural adjustment facility.\n    The spokesman said that if the agreement is renewed,\nBolivia can expect a further 60-mln-dlr stand-by loan over the\nnext 12 months.\n    Bolivia's agreement with the IMF, its first since 1980,\nopened the door to rescheduling negotiations with the Paris\nClub and Argentina and Brazil, which hold 2.5 billion dlrs of\nBolivia's 4.0-billion-dlr foreign debt.\n    Central Bank President Javier Nogales told Reuters the\nnegotiations with the Paris Club, which have yet to be\nfinalised, had been extremely successful.\n    Nogales said the Paris Club had agreed to reschedule\nBolivia's debt over 10 years with five to six years grace and\nhad waived all interest payments until the end of 1988.\n    Bilateral discussions on interest rates continue, he said.\n    Nogales said Bolivia was expecting some 400 mln dlrs in\ndisbursements this year from lender countries and international\nagencies, including the World Bank and the Inter-American\nDevelopment Bank, although diplomatic and banking sources put\nthe figure at closer to 300 mln dlrs.\n    Nogales said Bolivia's net international reserves are\naround 250 mln dlrs, up from one mln dlrs when President Ictor\nPaz Estenssoro took office in august 1985. Nogales said the\ncapital flow on Bolivia's debt servicing versus new credits had\nchanged from a net outflow of 200 mln dlrs in 1985 to a net\ninflow of 130 mln dlrs in 1986.\n    Bolivia's return from the financial wilderness follows paz\nestenssoro's economic stabilisation program.

He said Bolivia's commercial bank\nsteering committee agreed at a meeting in New York to consider\nthe proposal, but it is still unclear what proportion of the\ncountry's creditor banks will take up the offer.\n    One foreign banker speculated that Bolivia might be able to\nbuy back up to 30 pct of its commercial debt paper under the\ndeal, mostly from small banks who have written off their loans\nto the country.\n    But he said the larger creditors were more interested in a\nscheme of debt-equity swaps, similar to that which has operated\nin Chile for the past two years.\n    The Bolivian government has yet to draw up proposals for\ndebt-equity swaps, but the banker said it was planning to\nprivatise more than 100 state companies and these could serve\nas a basis for such a scheme.\n    Foreign bankers said this type of proposal might prove\nattractive to Bolivia in the long run, especially as the\ngovernment realises that it will have to attract a large amount\nof new capital in order to grow.\n    Planning Minister Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada told Reuters\nthat Bolivia was hoping for five to six billion dlrs in new\ninvestment over the next 10 to 12 years.\n    The government realises that in order to remain viable,\nBolivia will need to develop new exports.\n    The price of tin, which accounted for some 45 pct of\nBolivia's exports in 1984, has collapsed on

the upper\nintervention (\"may sell\") price (231 cts) or below the lower\nintervention (\"may buy\") price (171 cts) for six months.\n    If this happened -- but delegates said it was unlikely\nconsidering that the present indicator price averages 196 cts\n-- the price would be revised under the current accord by five\npct or by whatever amount the International Natural Rubber\nCouncil decides.\n    The new reference price would then be taken over for the\nnew agreement.\n    Under the same circumstances in the new pact the reference\nprice would be automatically revised by five pct unless the\nCouncil decides on a higher percentage.\n    Similarly, if buffer stock purchases or sales amounting to\n300,000 tonnes have been made since the last revision, the\nreference price will be lowered or raised by three pct unless\nthe Council decides on a higher percentage.\n    Another change introduced in the new INRA is that price\nreviews will be held at 15-month intervals instead of 18.\n    Those changes are intended to make the reference price more\nresponsive to market trends.\n    As in the present accord the \"may buy\" and \"may sell\" levels\nare set at plus or minus 15 pct of the reference price, and the\n\"must buy\" and \"must sell\" levels at 20 pct of it.\n    The lower and upper indicative prices (floor and ceiling\nprices) will remain fixed at 150 and 270 cents, unless the\nCouncil decides to revise them at reviews held every 30 months.\n    During the negotiations, consumers abandoned a proposal\nthat the floor price be adjusted downward if the buffer stock,\ncurrently 360,000 tonnes, rose to 450,000 tonnes.\n    The maximum size of the buffer stock in the new pact is the\nsame as under the present one -- 400,000

nearly its whole life, the 1979 accord\nhad maintained the average price above the \"must buy\" level.\n    They said the agreement until now did not appear to have\nencouraged excessive production of

adversely affecting\nAustralia's economic performance, Australian Petroleum\nExploration Association (APEA) chairman Dennis Benbow said.\n    Over one-third of Australia's indirect tax income is\nderived from oil at a time of falling domestic output and weak\ncrude prices, he told the APEA annual conference here.\n    This dependence on oil-generated revenue distorts the\ncountry's economic performance directly by acting as a\ndisincentive to new exploration and indirectly by affecting\ntrading competitiveness through high energy costs, he said.\n    Australia's medium-term liquid fuel self-sufficiency\nposition is posing a major economic threat, yet the\ngovernment's response has been to load new tax burdens on the\noil industry, Benbow said.\n    Domestic oil output from existing fields is expected to\nfall to 280,000 barrels per day (bpd) in fiscal 1992/93 from\n546,000 bpd in 1985/86, reflecting mainly the decline of the\nBass Strait fields, he said.\n    Bass Strait reserves are now two-thirds depleted, with the\nthree largest fields 80 pct depleted, he said.\n    By 1992/93, Bass Strait output is expected to be just over\nhalf the 1985/86 level, assuming a number of so far undeveloped\nfields are brought on stream and enhanced recovery from\nexisting fields goes ahead, Benbow said.\n    Government projections of output from as yet undiscovered\nfields range from 40,000 to 130,000 bpd, he said.\n    Australian liquid fuel demand is forecast to rise to\n680,000 bpd in 1992/93 from 565,000 in 1985/86, implying a\ncrude oil gap of between 270,000 and 360,000 bpd in five years\ntime, he said.\n    At present world oil prices and the current value of the\nAustralian dollar, annual oil imports in 1992/93 would cost\nbetween 3.2 billion and 3.6 billion dlrs, Benbow said.\n    Despite intensive exploration in the early 1980's, the\naddition to reserves has been inadequate, he said.\n    For example, the 409 mln barrels discovered in the

Association (APEA) annual conference.\n    It appears ever more likely that new discoveries elsewhere\nwill not change this fact, he said.\n    McIvor said 37 of the world's 30,000 oil fields contain\nabout 35 pct of all oil ever discovered.\n    Only 11 of these 37 super-giant fields lie outside the\nMiddle East and only five of the 37 have been discovered in the\nlast 20 years, three of them in the Middle East, he said.\n    He also said that since 1970, the world has been consuming\n20 to 25 billion barrels a year while making discoveries at the\nrate of only 10 to 15 billion barrels a year.\n    More than half of remaining proved reserves are in the\nMiddle East, he said.\n    McIvor said it was important to continue to search for oil\noutside the Middle East because each addition contributes to a\ndiversity of supply desirable for global political and economic\nstability.\n    \"It is important to enhance the likelihood of home-country\ndiscoveries with measures such as non-discriminatory and stable\ntaxation, and minimum regulation, together with opening up of\nacreage for exploration,\" he said.\n    Increasing reliance on the Middle East will also boost

pct levy on old oil -- that discovered\nbefore September 1975 -- is now forcing the Broken Hill Pty Co\nLtd <BRKN.S>/Exxon Corp <XON> partnership to shut-in\nproduction, accelerating the decline in

70 pct.\n    \"The economics at an 80 pct levy are simply not attractive\nat oil prices below 30 dlrs,\" Story said.\n    Cutting the maximum levy rate to 70 pct would create higher\nlevels of

AMT will contest all three points.\n    The U.K. Companies Act allows the possibility of the\nwinding-up of what it defines as an association, and AMT will\nargue that the Tin Council falls within this definition, Arnold\nsaid.\n    The ITC has immunity except for the enforcement of an\narbitration award, and thus it is important for AMT that the\ncourt accepts that the winding-up petition represents a move to\nenforce an arbitration ruling.\n    The court originally decided that the winding-up petition\nwent wider than the enforcement of such a debt, an AMT\nspokesman said.\n    The appeal is unlikely to be heard for several months, but\na case brought by fellow ITC creditor Maclaine Watson is to be\nheard on April 28. This is a move by the metal broker to have a\nreceiver appointed over the ITC's assets.\n    Since similar arguments will be used in this case, it is\npossible that any appeal in the Maclaine Watson case could be\nconsolidated with AMT's appeal, Arnold said.\n    Other ITC creditors have brought direct actions against the\nCouncil's member states and an application by the governments\nto strike out the first of these, brought by J.H.

This has been viewed\nwith concern by some members who fear the INRA may become\nindebted and ultimately face collapse, like the International\nTin Agreement.\n    \"This will ensure the buffer stock operation is carried out\nwithout any financial encumbrance,\" Lim said.\n     Malaysia, the world's largest producer, was seeking\ncabinet approval to join the new INRA and hoped other producers\nand consumers would also become members, he said.\n    Officials in Jakarta said the new pact would bring benefit\nto Indonesia's rubber industry's by stabilising prices.\n    It was unlikely to collapse like the tin agreement because\nits new financial provisions had been tightened, they said.\n    Thai officials told Reuters they were optimistic the new\npact was viable because it strictly limited the extent of debt\nthe INRA buffer stock manager might commit to his market\noperations.\n     Malaysian growers, however, said they preferred a free\nrubber market because an INRA had a tendency to keep prices at\nlevels that were only acceptable to consumers.\n    \"With the INRA's ability to keep prices at a certain stable\nlevel, consumers are assured of rubber at almost a fixed price,\nwhile producers may never see sharp price rises,\" a Malaysian\nRubber Producers Council source told Reuters.\n    Producers also wanted a free rubber market without the\noverhang of a 360,000 tonne INRA buffer stock which had\npsychologically prevented price rises, he said.\n    State plantation officials in Sri Lanka said prices had\nbeen depressed since INRA's inception and the creation of a\nbuffer stock, and they seemed unlikely to rise.\n    Sri Lanka should not be a member of the INRA because it was\nexpensive to maintain a buffer stock, they added.\n    Traders in the region, meanwhile, said prices might be\npressured by the new pact in the long term as its potential to\nstabilise prices and buffer stock capacity would spur producers\nto produce more.\n    Most Malaysian and Singapore traders said the new pact's\nconclusion had little impact on prices and it was unlikely to\nallow sharp price fluctuations in future.\n    \"The 360,000 tonnes in the INRA buffer stock must be\nliquidated and a free market returned,\" a Malaysian trader said.\n    Japanese traders said the new pact had a chance for success\nas most world producers and consumers had adopted it, but they\nquestioned the ability of some financially-strapped producers\nto finance buffer stock operations.\n REUTER\n", "Ciba-Geigy AG <CIGZ.Z> said it would\nestablish a joint venture with Phillips Petroleum Co.

\"As a major sugar producer we are urging them to write a new\nagreement which would revive world prices,\" Yulo said.\n    \"If there is no agreement world prices will always be\ndepressed,

By January, its estimate of 1986\nplanted acreage nationwide was 10.06 mln.\n    Analysts said their forecasts for even greater acreage in\n1987 were spurred in part by belief that this year's good\ndemand and firm prices will be repeated next year. Analysts\nsaid those factors make cotton a profitable crop.\n    \"With cotton more attractive price-wise, I think there is\ngoing to be a switch in acreage from soybeans to cotton.\nSoybeans are dirt cheap,\" said Lisbeth Keefe of Cargill\nInvestor Services, whose comments were echoed by other cotton\nmarket specialists.\n    Changes in the U.S. cotton program also could lead to\nincreased acreage, analysts said.\n    They recalled that under the 1986 program, cotton farmers\nwho used part of their crop as collateral for government loans\nwere not responsible for the cost of storing that cotton in\ngovernment warehouses. But under the 1987 plan, the government\nwill not pick up the tab for storage.\n    Analysts said the change will discourage some farmers from\nparticipating in the program, which could result in more\ncotton. \"The cotton program stipulates a mandatory set-aside of\n25 pct of a farmer's base acreage,\" noted Judy Weissman of\nShearson Lehman Brothers. But farmers who elect not to\nparticipate in the program are free to plant all the acreage \nthey have.\n    Some analysts said cotton farmers in the high-yielding\nWestern states would be most likely to steer clear of the\nprogram. \"Western acreage should be up at least 20 pct,\" said\none commission house analyst, whose estimate was based in part\non forecasts made by the National Cotton Council during its\nannual meeting in late January.\n    But others disagreed. \"I think some Western growers have\ndecided they should be in the program for security reasons.\nThere's a lot of comfort in knowing you'll be guaranteed the\ngovernment's loan price of 52.25 cents a lb. Anyone outside the\nprogram is subject to the wiles of the market,\" said Walter\nBrown, market analyst for a major California cotton producer.\n    Some cotton specialists said their expectations for\nincreased acreage might not be verified in Tuesday's planting\nintentions report. \"Anything the USDA is announcing now is\nbased on information they gathered before their cotton program\nwas announced (on March 20),\" one analyst cautioned. She said\ntraders will get a better idea of next year's cotton output\nwhen the USDA's planted acreage report is released on July 9.\n    Brown took that opinion a step further. \"I don't think\nplanted acreage is important. What counts is the abandonment\nrate,\" the difference between acreage planted and acreage\nharvested.\n    Brown said the abandonment rate this year was \"pretty high\"\nat 15.5 pct because of weather problems in key producing\nstates. \"More normal would be about six pct,\" he said.\n Reuter\n", "The Baltic International Freight Futures\nExchange (BIFFEX) said it agreed to pursue negotiations with\nother futures markets on the Baltic Exchange with a view to\nmerging into a new futures exchange.\n    Legal advisers have already been instructed to implement\namalgamation of the London Potato Futures Association, the Soya\nBean Meal Futures Exchange and the London Meat Futures\nExchange.\n    The London Grain Futures Market has also discussed merging\nwith the other markets.\n    The aim of the merger is to seek Recognised Investment\nExchange status as required by the 1986 Financial Services Act.\n Reuter\n", "Henley Group Inc's M.W.

At present pre-market trading is almost\nexclusively dollar-based, but currency conversions have to be\ndone during the sterling rings, they added.\n    LME ring dealers said the new contract would match more\nclosely trade requirements and possibly alleviate some of the\nrecent wide backwardations.\n    Very little physical business is now done in 99.50 pct\npurity metal, nearly all of which is produced in Eastern Bloc\ncountries, such as Romania.\n    The Soviet Union also produces 99.50 pct, but has declined\nas an exporter recently, they said.\n    Some dealers said the new 99.70 contract may suffer from\nliquidity problems initially, as business may continue to\ncentre on the present good ordinary brand (gob) contract, where\nthere are many holders of large short positions on the LME.\n    But others said the new contract would soon attract trading\ninterest, given that much 99.70 metal has already been\nattracted to the LME's warehouses by backwardations.\n    The LME also has a much more viable liquidity base for a\nnew contract, compared to the Comex market in New York, where\nhigh grade aluminium futures are not particularly active, they\nsaid.\n    Thus, it seems likely that the sterling contract will\neventually lose trading interest and volumes will decline. Like\nstandard zinc, which was superseded by a high grade contract,\ngob aluminium will probably be replaced, although the process\nin this case may take longer, they added.\n    Forming a new contract and establishing a Singapore\nwarehouse are constructive moves by the LME but backwardations,\nwhich make physical trading difficult, would not totally\ndisappear as a result, the trade sources said.\n    These premiums for prompt metal have become a\nsemi-permanent feature over the last year, due to increased\nbusiness and volatility in traded options, and are presently\naround 50 stg.\n    Increasingly large granting of option positions has been\ntaking place. When some of these are declared and exercised at\nthe end of the relevant month, physical tightness and squeezes\naround these dates are commonplace, they said.\n    Listing Singapore as a delivery point allows Far Eastern\noperators to deliver aluminium into a LME warehouse instead of\nhaving to cover.\n    But tightness and backwardations are seen continuing, even\nthough the LME's new option

It gained 26 mln new mouths to feed during\nthe two years.\n    \"We lost very little land prior to 1980 when the\nindustrialisation began,\" official Xu said. \"Since then, nearly\nall the families in the county have built new homes and many\nfactories have gone up.\"\n    \"Last year we lost land to a new railway line,\" Xu said. But\nland losses in future should fall because nearly all families\nalready have new houses, she added.\n    The issue of land loss is a matter of major concern to the\nPeking leadership, which announced earlier this month that\nChina will issue nationwide quotas for conversion of grain land\nfor the first time this year.\n    \"The present situation of abusing, occupying unlawfully,\nwasting and destroying land and land resources is serious,\" said\nan article in the official press explaining the new measures.\n    \"It has resulted in great losses of cultivated farmland,\" it\nsaid. \"China has a large population and its land resources are\nbadly deficient.\"\n    An official of the Shanghai city government said county\nauthorities could approve conversion of only 0.3 hectares of\narable land to other uses, while anything more than that must\nbe approved by the city government.\n   The Peking government faces another major obstacle in its\nefforts to ensure China's people get enough grain to eat. The\nprices the state pays to farmers for grain are too low, making\nit more profitable for them to grow other crops.\n    To offset this, the state offers farmers cheap fertiliser\nand diesel oil and payment in advance for grain it contracts to\nbuy. The state then sells the grain at subsidised prices to\nChina's 200 mln city residents. Rural factories also subsidise\ngrain output, paying farmers bonuses to grow it.\n    Some officials argue that the simplest solution to the\nproblem would be for the state to raise city grain prices.\n    Chen Zuyuan, Communist Party secretary of a village in the\neastern province of Zhejiang, said the government listened too\nmuch to the demands of \"selfish city people\" and could raise city\ngrain prices without any problem.\n    But the government has ruled out a price rise. \"Raising the\nprice of grain would directly conflict with the goal of social\nstability,\" said a China Daily editorial this month.\n    The Shanghai official said prices must be reformed over the\nlong term. \"We must be very careful. We have a very large\npopulation which is used to price stability and will object to\nprice rises,\" he said. \"The problem is how to do it.\"\n    The Shanghai official said a rise in grain prices might\nalso affect the prices of hundreds of food products made with\ngrain and consumed by city residents.\n    In addition, the state faces the problem of inadequate\ninvestment by farmers in land and in grain in particular.\n    The official press has reported that farmers fear farm\npolicy may change and they are putting their new wealth into\nbuilding graves, memorial halls for ancestors and homes.\n    Under reforms introduced in the late 1970s, farmers sign\ncontracts with the state requiring them to grow certain crops,\nbut they have considerable freedom in how to use their land.\n    \"As the expiration date of the 15-year contract is almost at\nthe halfway mark, farmers are beginning to worry about the\nfuture,\" the China Daily said in an editorial last month.\n    Their anxieties stem from the fact that they are allowed to\nuse the land but not own it. For most of the period of\nCommunist rule, the land was organised into collectives where\nthere was little room for individual initiative.\n    \"New measures are needed to reassure them of the consistency\nof government policies and make them interested in long-term\ninvestment,\" the newspaper said.\n REUTER\n", "Malaysia said it cut the gazetted\nprice of rubber to 202-7/8 cents per kg from 213-1/2 cents in\nMarch, effective immediately.\n    No export duty is applicable at this level, against 3/8\ncent per kg last month, because the government raised the\nexport duty threshold price to 210 cents per kg in early 1985.\n    The cess for rubber research and replanting remained\nunchanged at 3.85 and 9.92 cents per kg respectively.\n REUTER\n", "Malaysian miners criticised the\nU.S. For violating an agreement with Southeast Asian producers\nby selling more stockpiled tin in 1986 than agreed.\n    The U.S. General Services Administration sold 5,490 tonnes\nof tin in 1986, well above an agreed upon annual limit of 3,000\ntonnes, the States of Malaya Chamber of Mines said.\n    In its latest annual report, it said the U.S. Had promised\nto limit sales of tin in a memorandum of understanding signed\nwith the six-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations\n(ASEAN) in December 1983.\n    \"The U.S. Appears to have lost sight of the U.S./ASEAN\nMemorandum of Understanding,\" the Chamber said.\n    The Chamber estimated the U.S. Strategic stockpile held\n180,444 tonnes of tin in December 1986, 137,744 tonnes in\nexcess of of its original stockpile goal of 42,700.\n    The main ASEAN tin producers are Malaysia, Indonesia and\nThailand, which produce the bulk of the world's tin.\n REUTER\n", "The Ghana Cocoa Board said it purchased\n214 tonnes of cocoa in the 24th week, ended March 19, of the\n1986/87 main crop season, compared with 456 tonnes the previous\nweek and 372 tonnes in the 24th week ended March 27 of the\n1985/86 season.\n    Cumulative purchases so far this season stand at 217,449\ntonnes, ahead of the 204,256 tonnes purchased by the 24th week\nof last season.\n REUTER\n", "London traders say the European Community\nis likely to award a maximum rebate of 46.80 European currency\nunits per 100 kilos at today's tender, while traders in Paris\npredict a maximum award of 46.40 Ecus.\n    Last week the EC awarded licences for 59,000 tonnes at a\nrebate of 45.678 Ecus.\n    Trade views differed on the amount of sugar likely to be\nreleased today.\n    London traders said the EC Commission will probably\nendeavour to release a large tonnage, and as much as  100,000\ntonnes may be authorised for export under licences up to\nend-September.\n    Paris traders put the likely tonnage at around 60,000.\n  REUTER\n", "A proposed sales tax on gold transactions\ncould put a damper on the Tokyo market and encourage a shift of\ntrading to Hong Kong and Singapore, senior vice president and\nTokyo branch manager of Credit Suisse Paul Hofer told a press\nconference.\n    \"If you impose five pct on both buy and sell transactions,\nTokyo participants in the gold market could be out of business,\"\nhe said.

He also\nsaid altnerative energy sources should be encouraged.\n     Restoration of the depletion allowance for a 27 pct\ndeduction from the taxable income of oil companies is \ncontroversal but might work, said Dunham.\n    Dunham and other officials opposed the idea of a fee on oil\nimports but said if one is enacted it must tax crude and\nproduct imports.\n    \"Why would companies import crude when they could import\nproducts for a smaller cost if there were only a fee on crude?\"\nasked Henry Rosenberg, chairman of Crown Central Petroleum\n<CNP>.\n     An import fee would raise the costs of U.S. petrochemical\nproducts and make them noncompetive on the world market, Dunham\nsaid.\n     \"The energy security issue should be considered when\nenvironmental issues are considered,\" Martin said.\n    \"The level of investment for the proposed lowering of\nsulfur level of diesel to 0.05 pct by weight, for example, is\nunacceptable,\" Dunham said. \"Most companies cannot afford it.\"\n    George Unzelman, president of HyOx, Inc., said these\nproposals \"will place pressure on small refining operations and\npromote further industry consolidation.\"\n     An NPRA survey of of 139 refineries, which was released at\nthe conference, said reducing sulphur content to 0.05 pct\nweight and aromatics to 20 volume pct aromatics in highway\ndiesel fuel would cost refiners 6.65 billion dlrs.\n     The national average diesel fuel sulfur content in 1986\nfor the survey respondents was 0.27 weight pct while the\naverage aromatics content was 32 pct.\n     Another possible cost to refiners is the upgrading of\nfacilities to produce a third grade of unleaded gasoline which\nis beginning to be marketed by some companies.\n    \"What will be the standard octane level in various grades\nof unleaded gasoline?\" asked Dunham. \"A midlevel grade of\nunleaded gasoline with an octane level of 89 means an\ninvestment has to be made,\" Dunham said.\n     This grade is not warranted, said Crown's Rosenberg.\n     Despite these concerns, refiners are expecting margins to\nmove higher in the next few months.\n     \"We are beginning to see a return in wholesale margins,\"\nsaid Roger Hemminghaus, chairman of the refining and marketing\ncompany that is to spin off from Diamond Shamrock Corp <DIA>.\n     Margins are higher because the OPEC pact is holding, U.S.\nstocks of gasoline and heating oil are declining, and gasoline\ndemand is rising as the driving season approaches, he said.\n     \"This summer could be a good season for selling gasoline,\"\nHemminghaus said, adding that the new company will be primarily\na gasoline producer.\n Reuter\n", "Magma Copper Co, a subsidiary of\nNewmont Mining Corp, said it is lowering its copper cathode\nprice by 0.25 cent to 65.50 cents a lb, effective immediately.\n Reuter\n", "Inspiration Consolidated Copper Co, a\nsubsidiary of Inspiration Resources Corp, said it is lowering\nits base price for full-plate copper cathodes one-half cent to\n66.50 cents a lb, effective immediately.\n Reuter\n", "Argentine vegetable oils shipments\nduring January/December 1986 totalled 1,796,121 tonnes, against\n1,577,722 tonnes in the same period of 1985, the Argentine\nGrain Board said.\n    Breakdown was as follows: cotton 9,000 (27,900), sunflower\n954,303 (840,440), linseed 119,954 (138,944), groundnutseed\n26,248 (26,246), soybean 669,094 (524,715), tung 9,047\n(11,363), olive 2,417 (4,125), maize 6,058 (3,989), rape nil\n(nil) , grape nil (nil), the board added.\n    Shipments during December 1986 amounted to 102,870 tonnes,\nagainst 108,514 tonnes in the same month of 1985.\n    The breakdown, was as follows, in tonnes:\n    Cotton 5,000 (nil), sunflower 25,156 (23,713), linseed\n6,127 (5,990), groundnutseed nil (738), soybean 65,759\n(76,371), tung 645 (730), olive 183 (660), maize nil (312),\nrape nil (nil), grape nil (nil), the board said.    \n    The ten principal destinations during January/December\n1986, with comparative figures for the same period of 1985 in\nbrackets, were as follows, in tonnes:\n    Iran 212,043 (209,177), Holland 204,558 (215,784), Soviet\nUnion 173,060 (266,389), Egypt 163,119 (164,252), Algeria\n116,330 (11,492), South Africa 105,230 (110,064), Brazil\n101,599 (103,142), Cuba 89,957 (98,740), United States 80,109\n(44,826), India 67,182 (17,403), the board said.\n REUTER\n", "Gulf barge freight rates continued to\nshow a firmer tone in the nearbys on the assumption that\nchanges in the Gulf posted prices will encourage increases in\nboth PIK-and-roll activity and barges shipments, with a total\nof 21 barges traded this morning on the ST Louis Merchants'\nExchange call session, versus nine yesterday, dealers said.\n    Quotes included -\n -

Stangeland and\nother supporters said the proposal would have no effect on the\nstatus of foreign trade zones.\n    Sugar producer groups pushed for the amendment on\nsugar-containing products because they believe sugar is being\nshipped to the United States in food products as a way to\ncircumvent the quota on raw sugar.\n    The sugar quota is only one mln short tons this year.\n Reuter\n", "The Environmental Protection Agency\nproposed rules to shield water supplies from potential leaks\nfrom 1.4 mln underground storage tanks, nearly half of which\nare used to store gasoline at service stations.\n    It said the rules would require owners and operators of the\ntanks containing petroleum products or certain hazardous\nchemicals to monitor the tanks for leaks and, in case of leaks,\nto notify appropriate authorities.\n    The owners and operators of petroleum tanks would also be\nfinancially responsible for any contamination, the EPA said.\n    It said financial requirements for chemical tanks will be\nproposed later.\n    Hazardous tanks are regulated separately.\n    EPA Administrator Lee Thomas said \"Thousands of underground\nstorage tanks are currently leaking and, without adequate\ncontrols, many more can be expected to leak in the future,\nendangering our nation's drinking-water supplies.\"\n    He added in a statement \"We intend to ensure that each\nunderground tank is either upgraded or closed down and that\nsafe operating and cleanup procedures are following to provide\nmaximum protection from any future leaks.\"\n reuter\n", "Seventeen miners who were\nmissing in a copper mine fire were found today and efforts were\nunderway to rescue them and 29 others who were trapped but safe\nin an underground lunch room, officials said.\n    The mine's owner, Noranda Inc., said one miner died in the\nfire, six miners escaped unharmed, 29 made it to an underground\nlunch room, where they had air and water, and 17 were later\nfound safe in other lunch rooms.\n Reuter\n", "Shoppers who buy Haagen-Daas ice cream,\nDijon mustard or Tuborg beer on their weekly trip to the\nsupermarket are soon to be the target of a promotional blitz\nfor national-brand \"gourmet\" coffees.\n    General Foods, the largest U.S. coffee roaster, and A and\nP, which shares the third place in the U.S. market, are the\nonly two national brand roasters so far to introduce the\nhigher-quality coffees into selected supermarkets.\n    But industry insiders believe there is substantial growth\npotential in upscale coffee, despite years of flat sales in\nregular ground roast types.\n    \"I would suspect General Foods will make a name for\nthemselves with their gourmet line,\" said a coffee trade\nsource. \"What it could do is really dent the small-store,\nwhole-bean business,\" the trade source added.\n    The new lines are designed to appeal to a classic\nadvertising composite--the \"yuppie\" consumer.\n    They buy fresh pasta, subscribe to Bon Appetit magazine and\nwere \"first on their block with a wok,\" as described by Karin\nBrown, General Foods senior product manager for its new coffee,\ncalled Private Collection out of GF's Maxwell House division.\n    Paul Gallant, president of A and P's Compass Foods\nsubsidiary that makes the new A and P gourmet line, described\nits potential appeal as \"a status thing.\"\n    At an initial price of 4.99 dlrs for 12 ounces it is\nexpensive, though not more so than high quality coffee sold in\nsmall specialty stores. General Foods' Maxwell House Div. has\njust cut the price on its new offering by 50 cents to 4.49 dlrs\nfor 12 ounces--a move competitor A and P is bound to imitate,\naccording to an A and P executive.\n    Number two U.S. roaster Folgers has \"nothing to announce at\nthis point\" in the gourmet line, a spokesman said. Neither does\nHills Bros., a subsidiary of Nestle that shares the third and\nfourth size market spot by volume with A and P.\n    Competitors believe Folgers will watch the progress of\nGeneral Foods' offering, prepared to jump in if the market\ntakes off.\n    General Foods and A and P hope their new products will help\npush coffee sales out of the doldrums. Coffee consumption in\nthe United States has fallen 44 pct since 1962, according to a\n1986 study by the International Coffee Organization. Sales show\nno signs of picking up.\n    Compass's Gallant blames the falloff on declines in coffee\nquality since the 1960's and aggressive soft drink marketing.\n    \"The national brands began to cheapen the blend in the name\nof profit but spent 100 mln dlrs a year telling consumers this\nwas quality coffee,\" Gallant said.\n    As a result, first time consumers never got a taste for the\nbrew. The first time a young consumer tries coffee, \"they turn\naround and say 'My God this is awful, I think I'll have a\nCoke',\" he said.\n    Having now mostly written off the 16-25 age group, who have\nconfirmed their loyalty to soft drinks, coffee marketers are\naiming at the high income, free-spending, self-treating crowd\n-- the yuppie composite.\n    \"Where else are you going to go?,\" an industry source said.\n\"Kids aren't going to drink coffee, that's apparent. There are\nno other markets. The only area that's not been promoted is\ngourmet,\" he said.\n    In addition to perking up sales, success in the gourmet\nline could provide much higher margins to roasters than regular\nground roast coffees produce.\n    Generally, retail prices are about twice the price of\ngreen, unroasted coffee beans, taking into account the costs of\nroasting, packaging and distribution, and then deducting\noften-generous trade discounts. Supermarkets tend to sell\ncoffee near the trade price as a \"loss leader,\" a product\ndesigned to draw shoppers into the store.\n    But with the new gourmet lines, a different pricing\nstructure prevails, industry sources said. There is no trade\ndiscounting and an emphasis on expensive packaging, including a\nspecial valve designed to keep the beans fresher.\n    Dealers said roasters were buying the higher quality green\nbeans at about 1.60 dlrs a lb.

The buffer stock may begin buying shortly as the\nICCO 10 day average indicator price is now at 1,578.03 Special\nDrawing Rights (SDR) per tonne, below the 1,600 \"must buy\" level.\n    Rules governing buffer stock operations were agreed last\nmonth by the ICCO council. Buying will begin once the buffer\nstock manager has completed preparations, traders said.\n    Some traders said the buffer stock manager may delay buffer\nstock buying until mid or end-April when changes in months used\nto calculate the ICCO indicator may lift the 10 day average\nabove the 1,600 SDR \"must buy\" level.\n    The ICCO indicator price is calculated from the average of\nthe second, third and fourth positions on the London and New\nYork futures markets. The daily price was 1,577.61 SDR per\ntonne yesterday.\n    Months used currently for the indicator are May, July and\nSeptember, but these are set to change to July, September and\nDecember on April 15, prior to May becoming the New York spot\nmonth, traders noted.\n    The introduction of December into the calculations may lift\nthe daily SDR price as December is currently quoted about 75\nstg above May on the London terminal market.\n    But the buffer stock manager would have to wait for the\nhigher daily price to feed through into the 10-day average, the\nindicator which governs his activities, traders said.\n    \"The buffer stock manager is obviously looking at the\nimplications of delaying until forward prices lift the\nindicator since it might mean he has to buy less cocoa,\" an\nanalyst from a leading cocoa trade house said.\n    Traders said the buffer stock purchases could reach 75,000\ntonnes fairly quickly once buying starts. If purchases reach\nthis level within six months, buying is suspended pending an\nICCO council review of price ranges. But some cocoa market\nwatchers said the buffer stock may benefit from recent\nforecasts for a poor Brazilian Bahia temporao crop at 1.5 mln\nto two mln 60 kilo bags against initial expectations of up to\nthree mln.\n    A lower than expected Brazilian crop may cut the 1986/87\nworld surplus to between 50,000 and 70,000 tonnes, compared\nwith a recent forecast by the ICCO statistics committee of\n94,000 tonnes, traders said.\n    In these circumstances, the buffer stock may only need to\nbuy between 20,000 and 30,000 tonnes to lift prices above the\n\"must buy\" level.\n    But some dealers said the ICCO buffer stock rules may put\nconstraints on how quickly and effectively the buffer stock\nmanager can remove cocoa from the market.\n    The buffer stock system of price differentials set\naccording to quality and a 15 pct limit on purchases from\nnon-members could limit the buffer stock's scope for action,\ndealers said.\n    Most of the cocoa readily available to the buffer stock is\nnearby in-store material of Malaysian and Ivory Coast origin.\n    But the buffer stock can only buy 15 pct Malaysian cocoa as\nMalaysia is not an ICCO member, while purchases of nearby cocoa\ncan only reach 40 pct in any one day, which forces the buffer\nstock to buy some intermediate and forward shipment material.\n    Limits on buffer stock purchases of nearby and non-member\ncocoa will reduce the impact on terminal prices which are\npressured by the overhang of Malaysian material, traders said.\n    Buffer stock purchases of forward shipment cocoa from\nquality producers such as Ghana will have only a limited impact\non futures, but is likely to widen physical market premiums for\nthis cocoa over futures.\n    Ghana's premium to the terminal has risen to about 50 stg\nfrom 25 to 30 stg a month ago partly in anticipation of buffer\nstock buying, dealers said.\n    \"The buffer stock may not help the terminal market, but will\nprovide a backstop for quality cocoas,\" one trader said.\n    Traders cautioned that views on the impact of the buffer\nstock were \"all prognostication\" and that no one could hope to\npredict accurately what the result would be. Psychologically\nbuffer stock buying should help prices, but since the buffer\nstock already holds a carryover of 100,000 tonnes from the\nprevious cocoa agreement and the market is in surplus, dealers\nexpressed doubts purchases can counter bearish pressure.\n    In June the ICCO is due to discuss rules for a withholding\nscheme as an additional market support mechanism.\n REUTER\n", "Greece and the Soviet Union have reached\nagreement in Moscow on a joint venture for a 450 mln dlr\nalumina plant in Greece, government spokesman Yannis Roubatis\nsaid.\n    Roubatis told reporters the Soviet Union agreed to buy the\nplant's entire annual output of 600,000 tonnes of alumina.

That distaste stems in part from fears of recession.\n    Outgoing Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman told\ntelevision interviewers he did not think a policy of driving\nthe dollar down would solve the U.S. trade deficit.\n    \"It would slow growth in Germany and Japan which would\nadversely affect our trade balance and ultimately it would\ndrive interest rates up here which would throw us, if not\n(into) recession, into slower growth,\" he said.\n    Asked if higher U.S. Interest rates would stabilize the\ndollar, Balladur said: \"When a currency is maintained\nartificially high, by artificially high interest rates, it is\nnot healthy.\"\n    And resorting to higher interest rates could lead to\nrecession, he said.\n    Acknowledging the dollar's latest slide was now a fact of\nlife, Balladur said, \"there may be adjustments of course in one\nor other currencies, this is not a fixed rate system.\"\n    But Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker said he\nmight rein in credit if the dollar's slide deepens.\n    U.S. Monetary sources also said Washington wanted it\nunderstood by markets the seven's commitments were genuine.\n    \"The United States and the six major industrial countries\nare fully committed to implementing our undertakings in these\nagreements,\" Baker told the meetings.\n    Darman said Baker had been misinterpreted by markets which\nwrongly believed earlier remarks suggested he wanted a further\ndecline in the dollar. Baker, Darman said, was committed to\nstabilizing currencies at current levels.\n    Last week's statement from the seven reaffirmed a February\n22 agreement in Paris in which the Reagan administration agreed\nto reach a budget deficit compromise with Congress and to fight\nprotectionism.\n    West Germany and Japan, meanwhile, agreed to stimulate\ndomestic demand and lead a global upturn.\n    Ministers believed the Paris pact was bolstered by Japan's\npromise of a 35 billion dlr supplementary budget.\n    The sources said they believed Baker saw it as a major\naction.

But as oil prices increase the long-term\neconomic outlook is favorable, oil industry experts said.\n    \"Estimated potential world reserves of extra heavy oils\nexceed 500 billion barrels, of which more than half are located\nin Venezuela,\" Juan Chacin Guzman, President of Petroleos de\nVenezuela told the World Petroleum Congress.\n    \"And this virtually unused resource represents a prime\nexample of the need to invest in technology to ensure\ntomorrow's energy future,\" he added.\n    Venezuela had to reduce heavy crude oil output in favor of\nlight oils because of economics and a very limited market. Not\nmany refineries have been upgraded to process the heavy oils.\n    \"Improved technology has the potential for reducing the\ncapital investment and operating costs of typical heavy oil\ndevelopment projects by 30 pct or more,\" Gordon Willmon, VP and\ngeneral manager, oil sands and coal department, Esso Resources\nCanada Ltd said at the World Petroleum Congress.\n    Crude oil prices fell under 10 dlrs dlrs a barrel last\nsummer as OPEC members increased production to gain market\nshare, but have since risen to around 18 dlrs because the  OPEC\nproduction/pricing agreement is basically in tact.\n    Willmon said light and medium crude oils currently supply\n90 pct of world oil demand yet they account for less than 25\npct of remaining petroleum resources.\n    \"So future demand increasingly will be met from the various\nforms of heavy oil,\" Willmon said. Heavy crude oil resources\ninclude extra-heavy oil/tar sand, natural bituminous sands and\noil shales (in sedimentary rock).\n     Willmon cited major factors that will make heavy oil\ndevelopment economical, including real and stable growth in\ncrude oil prices, favorable fiscal terms, and improved\ntechnology.\n    He said he expects \"all pieces of the puzzle to fit\ntogether.\" But he cautioned that the short-term outlook is very\nsensitive to crude oil prices. And he said the most important\nfactor in development of heavy oils is the recovery of the\nprice of crude.\n    Willmon said the price of light crude must be about eight\ndlrs higher than heavy crude before there is an incentive for\nan oil company to upgrade its refinery to process heavy oil.\n    He said the current price differential is only about five\ndlrs a barrel.\n    Willmon indicated that a benchmark crude oil price above 20\ndlrs would be ideal. But he said currently under study are a\nbroad range of high potential cost-effective technologies for\nresources recovery, transportation and upgrading of heavy oils,\nwhich would permit commercial development despite a lower crude\noil price outlook.\n    Willmon said these technologies included enhanced recovery\nby steam injection and oil-and-water emulsion to reduce the\nviscocity of the heavy oils so they can flow easily through a\npipeline. He said such technologies may substantially reduce\ncurrent captial investment and operating costs.\n    But he emphasized that innovative technology alone may not\nencourage new investment, that oil prices need to show a\nmeaningful and sustained recovery.\n   Most of the expenses associated with heavy oils production\nis fixed operating costs as in an oil sands project, rather\nthan in exploration, according to Robert Smith, Senior VP\nOperations <Syncrude Canada Ltd>.\n    While exploration costs for conventional crude oil range\nfrom four to nine dlrs a barrel, discovery costs for synthetic\ncrude from oil sands are nearly zero because the location and\nnature of the deposit are known, according to Smith.\n    But the remote location of oil sands deposits mean that\neverything required to build and operate the plant must come\nfrom outside the area.\n    Willmon also said, \"Public policy could best help by\nproviding financial support to offset the high cost of\ntechnology developmemt which would help generate projects that\ncould survive even at low oil prices for extended periods of\ntime.\"\n    U.S. Energy Secretary John Herrington said, \"The Reagan\nAdministration is firmly committed, without equivocation, to\ncontinuing our efforts to improve conditions and incentives in\nthe marketplace that will spur oil and gas exploration and\ndevelopment.\"\n Reuter\n", "A bill that would impose an oil\nimport fee to support a world floor price for oil of 25 dlrs a\nbarrel was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives by\n12 Congressmen from oil-producing states.\n    The variable import fee would be dropped if oil prices rise\nabove 25 dlrs a barrel, sponsors of the bill said.\n    Revenues from the fee would be used to buy domestic oil\nfrom stripper wells - those that produce 10 barrels a day or\nless - at a fixed price of 25 dlrs a barrel. Purchases would\nstop when prices rose above that level.\n    \"Time is running out on the domestic oil and gas industry,\"\nRep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, said in a statement. \"An oil import\nfee is really just the premium for a national insurance\npolicy.\"\n    President Reagan opposes an oil import fee, but supporters\nof the

said Michael Phelps, vice president of <Westcoast\nTransmission Co Ltd>, a major Canadian natural gas carrier.\n    But Phelps predicted a fall in U.S. supply -- caused by a\nsharp drop in exploration -- and a slight demand increase\nshould help to burn off the excess supply by 1990.\n    As a result, Canadian gas exports to the U.S. market should\nrise to up to 1.5 trillion cubic feet a year by the end of the\ndecade, nearly double 1986's total.\n    The health of the Canadian industry is heavily dependent on\nthe U.S. market where nearly one third of Canada's gas\nproduction is sent.\n    Cuba Wadlington, a vice president at Northwest Pipeline\nCorp of Salt Lake City, shared the view that markets could be\nin balance by 1990.\n    He said while North American demand for natural gas has\nflattened at about 18 trillion cubic feet a year, a return to\nmore colder winters in the next few years could quickly tighten\nsupplies.\n    \"Things are clearly working towards a shrinking of the\nbubble,\" Wadlington told Reuters in an interview.\n    However, recent decisions by the U.S. Federal Energy\nRegulatory Commission (FERC) were sharply criticized by\nCanadian delegates who suggested the moves could prevent the\ncountry from participating in the market's recovery.\n    The key dispute, known as the as billed issue, involves a\nruling last December by FERC which effectively bars U.S.\npipeline companies and consumers from paying certain Canadian\nshipping expenses.\n    The Canadian government believes the ruling could severely\nweaken the country's gas producers. \"Besides the\nextra-territorial effect, there is the potential that Conadian\nproducers and consumers may end up subsidizing the cost of\ntransportation services originally incurred on behalf of U.S.\ncustomers,\" said Robert Skinner, an assistant deputy minister in\nCanada's energy department.\n    But FERC Chairman Martha Hesse told the conference the\nruling was really intended \"to assure equal, fair and open\ncompetition in the pricing of natural gas sold within our\ncountry -- whatever the source of the gas.\"\n    Hesse maintained Canadian gas was crucial to the emergence\nof a freely competitive, continent-wide, energy market.\n    Speaking to concerns in Canada that the U.S. is seeking to\nlimit Canadian gas shipments, Hesse said such a move would

not free to compete,\" said Larry Makovich,\ndirector of utilities service at Data Resources Inc, \"problems\non pipeline open access and take-or-pay liabilities still weigh\nheavily on end-users' decision to switch to natural gas.\"\n    A manager with an East Coast gas distribution company,\nagreed that reluctance among end-users often stemmed from fear\nof unresolved regulatory issues.\n    \"The fact that at the federal level open access is not yet\nfirmly in place threatens to impede free flow of natural gas\nfrom producers to consumers,\" he said.\n     Michael German, an economist with the American Gas\nAssociation, said while a significant amount of gas was now\nreplacing oil in dual-fuel boilers, the progress of expanding\nthe marketshare of gas was slow. First quarter natural gas\nconsumption data is not available until June.\n    In the first three months of 1987, residual fuel demand\nfell by an average of 55,000 barrels per day, according to the\nAmerican Petroleum Institute. Natural gas, however, was not\nable to take full advantage of the decline in oil consumption.\n    AGA's German said that while industrial consumers were\nconcerned with regulatory issues in their long-range capital\ninvestment decisions, in the dual-fuel boiler market relied on\nspot purchases.\n    \"With all the capability of switching (from oil to natural\ngas) already there, price of the fuel is the only concern,\" he\nsaid, adding that compared with the same period last year,\nJanuary natural gas price at burner tip is 16 pct lower for\nindustrial users and 32 pct lower for utilities.\n    German attributed the sluggish performance of natural gas\nto lower demand in the utility sector as a whole.\n    \"March was warmer than normal, which cut down gas\nconsumption not only in home heating but also in electricity\ngeneration,\" he said.\n     In March, according to API monthly statistics, residual\nfuel deliveries fell by 13.6 pct to 1.2 mln barrels per day\nfrom the same period a year ago.\n    While API specifically mentioned lower natural gas prices\nhad put residual fuel at a price disadvantage among electric\nutilities and industrial users, industry analysts believed the\nrole of natural gas was over-stated.\n    Makovich of DRI noted much of the decline in oil in the\nfuel mix was taken up by new nuclear capacity coming on stream\nin the last few years.\n    Nuclear capacity rose nine pct in 1986, and he projected\nthe same rate of growth for 1987 and 11 pct growth in 1988. \n    In contrast, oil and gas together represented only 15 pct\nof the fuel mix in 1986 and should decline to 13 pct by 1989,\nhe said. Within this sector, gas share fell to 66 pct in 1986\nfrom 76 pct a year ago due to competition from falling oil\nprices, he added. But this year, gas was expected to recapture\nonly two pct of the share, Makovich said.\n    Michael German of AGA agreed and said, \"Nevertheless,\noutlet for several hundred billion cubic feet of gas a year is\nsignificant in a glutted market.\"\n Reuter\n", "Iran's navy commander warned that Iran\nwould close off the Strait of Hormuz, entrance to the Gulf, if\nthere was any disruption to its shipping or sea-bound trade,\nTehran radio said.\n    Commodore Mohammed Hoseyn Malekzadegan told a news\nconference Iran was ready to maintain security in the Gulf.\n    But he added \"If there is any disruption in the movement of\nour ships and our imports and exports, this waterway would not\nbe left open for any country.\"\n    The radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting\nCorporation, quoted Malekzadegan as saying Iran's navy now had\nthe most advanced defensive equipment, including long-range\nshore- to-sea missiles and a range of sea-to-sea missiles.\n    He said it had also expanded operations to cover the whole\nregion \"from the most northerly point in the Persian Gulf to the\nmost southerly part of the Sea of Oman.\"\n    Referring to U.S. fleet movements in and near the Gulf,\nMalekzadegan said they had so far not been directed against\nIran's interests.\n    \"Their movements have been on the basis of international\nregulations and in the open seas,\" the radio quoted him as\nsaying. \"However, if any movement or action is carried out\nagainst the interests of the Islamic Republic of Iran in\nwhatever context, we shall decisively confront that move.\"\n Reuter\n", "Nippon Mining Co Ltd president Yukio\nKasahara said the state-owned Japanese firm hoped to find\nadditional joint venture partners to explore for U.S. oil\nreserves.\n    \"We have to secure the stability of oil for Japan,\"\nKasahara told reporters at the World Petroleum Congress. \"In\nthe exploration area I think Japanese companies are interested\nin joint ventures.\"\n    Nippon Mining, for example, last September signed an\nagreement with Dupont Co's <DD> Conoco Inc to participate in a\n135 mln dlr exploration venture that includes six wells on land\nand 14 offshore Louisiana. The first joint well drilled is in\nthe Gulf of Mexico's Green Canyon Block 182, a deepwater lease\nthat Conoco was almost forced to return to the federal\ngovernment undrilled because of low oil prices.\n    \"At this moment we have no success but we will proceed with\nConoco.

Whether the price is\n18 dlrs or 20 dlrs, we don't care.\"\n    But encouraging additional upstream efforts may require\nmodestly higher oil prices, Kasahara added. \"For exploration I\nthink 20 dlrs a barrel or 22 dlrs a barrel would be\nreasonable,\" he said.\n    The key factor in determining whether the Organization of\nPetroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would raise its 18 dlr a\nbarrel benchmark price is the ongoing war between Iran and\nIraq, Kasahara said. Saudi Arabia, he added, was an uncertain\nelement in the OPEC equation because of its need to maintain\nrevenues at the same time the weakened U.S. dollar has reduced\noil profits.\n    Nippon Mining, which like all Japanese crude buyers is\nbenefitting from the drop in the value of the dollar, favors\ncontinuing to price OPEC crude oil according to U.S. currency\nregardless of the dollar-yen relationship, Kasahara said.\n    \"I hope the dollar would strengthen eventually and continue\nto improve.

a barrel have been made in Congress in an effort to cut\nthe federal budget deficit and maintain the momentum for energy\nconservation programs, which have been hurt by cheaper oil.\n    But by making foreign oil more expensive, the tariffs would\nreduce oil imports and force greater consumption of domestic\noil, which would deplete U.S. reserves faster, the study found.\n    \"Any attempt to increase our energy security by limiting\nimports will actually reduce our long-run energy security by\nspeeding the depletion of domestic reserves,\" the study said.\n    The five dlr a barrel tariff

At the same time, most were supportive of Hodel.\n     Environmental concerns, particularly in California, had\nlobbied strenuously against offshore oil development.\n     \"The (Outer Continental Shelf) leasing program fails to\ntake into account the environmental performance of the oil\nindustry,\" said Bill Bradford, executive vice president of\nDresser Industries <DI> and president of the Petroleum\nEquipment Suppliers Association.\n     Huff quoted National Academy of Science figures showing\noffshore rigs contributed only two pct of petroleum pollution\nin the oceans, while tankers were responsible for 47 pct and\nmuniciple dumping 31 pct.\n     \"The OCS is the keystone of the domestic reserve\ndevelopment program,\" said Siess, adding that with oil imports\nrising to 50 pct of U.S. oil consumption, the issue was one of\nnational security.\n     Looking ahead, Constantine S. Nicandros, president of\nDupont's <DD> Conoco Inc subsidiary, said, \"We are more likely\nto see a five pct increase in spending this year than the\nwidely-forecast five pct decrease.\"\n     Other optimistic signs include the recent sale in New\nOrleans of offshore tracts in the Gulf of Mexico which raised\n290 mln dlrs against an expected 90 mln.\n     However, Ronald Tappmeyer, vice chairman of Reading and\nBates Drilling Co <RB>, said the oversupply of rigs would\ncontinue for the near-term, but added demand for\ntechnologically advanced rigs would increase in the 1990s.\n     Much of that demand is seen coming from the move into\nicreasingly deeper waters, with the projects becoming ever more\nexpensive and needing five to ten years to develop.\n     Over 50 pct of the sales in New Orleans were for deep\nwater tracts.\n     Ronald L. Geer, a consultant with Shell Oil Co, a\nsubsidiary of Royal Dutch/Shell <RD>, and president of the\nMarine Technology Society, said the technology existed to drill\nexploratory wells in up to 10,000 feet of water.\n     Geer said the industry was particularly interested in the\nGreen Canyon field offshore Louisiana where a number of\ncompanies, including Shell, Conoco, USX Corp's Marathon Oil Co,\nStandard Oil Co <SRD> and Placid Oil Co, are working, many of\nthem testing new deep-water technologies involving floating\nplatforms.\n Reuter\n", "Iranian foreign minister Ali Akbar\nVelayati warned that Iran would combat any superpower\nintervention in the Gulf.\n    \"Iran, which is the most powerful (country) in the Gulf...\nWill not allow the superpowers or any other foreign forces to\ninterfere in the region,\" he said.\n    Velayati, visiting the United Arab Emirates on the first\nleg of a Gulf tour, told reporters Iran had the \"capabilities\nand means\" to prevent any interference.

But many experts say OPEC should\nchange prices quarterly or monthly to match seasonal demand for\nfuel oil-rich heavy crudes and gasoline-rich lighter grades. At\nits last meeting in December, OPEC agreed to reintroduce fixed\nprices from February 1 around an 18 dlr per barrel reference\npoint. Official prices had been effectively dropped in 1985\nwhen members offered discounts to attract customers.\n    OPEC also decided to limit first-half 1987 output to 15.8\nmln bpd and proposed ceilings of 16.6 mln for the third quarter\nand 18.3 mln for the fourth. Analysts expect it will now extend\nor raise slightly the current ceiling for the coming months.\n    Spot market and netback values for some crudes do not\nmirror official prices, but OPEC will probably keep the 18 dlr\ntarget and at most make minimal changes to differentials,\nanalysts say.\n    The 18 dlr figure is based on a basket of six OPEC and one\nnon-OPEC crudes. OPEC assigned prices to its other key export\ncrudes, with a 2.65 dlr gap between the heaviest and lightest.\nExtra heavy crudes were among those left out.\n    Industry estimates vary on the proportion of OPEC oil\nexports actually sold at official prices. Several experts say\nonly one-quarter to one-third of the total in fact sells at\nofficial prices, with some of the rest included in processing\nor barter deals or sold in the form of refined products.\n    Problems with the new structure appeared earlier this year,\nwhen some producers' output fell due to customer reluctance to\npay the new prices.\n   Nigeria especially found its gasoline-rich Bonny Light crude\n-- now OPEC's highest priced grade at 18.92 dlrs a barrel --\nwas uncompetitive on the spot market against Britain's Brent.\n    In February and March, Nigeria's production shrank below\nits 1.238 mln bpd OPEC quota. Spot prices have since revived,\ndue partly to seasonal demand for gasoline, and its output has\nrisen.\n    Some experts feel Bonny Light is still overvalued and say\nits price should be cut by between 50 cts to one dlr a barrel.\n    But Mehdi Varzi, chief oil analyst with London's Kleinwort\nGrieveson Securities, doubts Nigeria will actively push the\ndifferentials question in Vienna.\n    \"It would not look good for OPEC unity if Nigeria, which\nholds the presidency, raised the issue,\" he said.\n REUTER\n", "U.S. exporters will be able to sell\n8,000 head of dairy cattle to Indonesia and 5,000 head to\nTurkey under the Export Enhancement Program, the U.S.\nAgriculture Department said.\n    The export sales will be subsidized with commodities from\nthe inventory of the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), the\ndepartment said.\n    Indonesia and Turkey already have purchased 7,500 and 5,000\nhead of dairy cattle, respectively, under the program.\n    Details of the program and an invitation for offers from\nexporters will be issued in the near future, it said.\n Reuter\n", "Shell Canada <SHC>, whose majority\ninterest is owned by the Royal Dutch/Shell Group of companies,\nraised the postings of light sweet and sour crude oil from\nEdmonton/Swann Hills 32 Canadian cts a barrel, effective today.\n    The new price for light sweet crude oil is 25.60 Canadian\ndlrs a barrel while the new price for light sweet sour crude is\n24.08 Canadian dlrs a barrel.\n    The Royal Dtuch/Shell Group owns 72 pct of Shell Canada and\npublic shareholders, primarily Canadian, own the remaining 28\npct of the company, a Shell Canada spokesman said.\n Reuter\n", "Canadian Imperial Oil, 70 pct Exxon\nowned, said it raised its posting for light sweet crude oil at\nEdmonton by 32 canadian cts a barrel, effective today.\n    The company said its new posting for light sweet crude oil\nat Edmonton is 25.60 canadian dlrs a barrel.\n Reuter\n", "Dutch consumers and food processors\nwould be hit hard by the proposed EC tax on oils and fats, Dick\nde Bruyn, chairman of the commodity board for margarine, fats\nand oils, MVO, said at the annual meeting.\n    The Dutch are the second largest consumers of margarine and\nfourth largest consumers of vegetable oils in the EC.\n    The fiercely contested tax would be a levy on consumers and\nsteeply increase the costs of industries such as potato\nprocessing and cake and biscuit manufacturing, de Bruyn said.\n    \"A move by these industries to countries outside the EC\ncannot be ruled out,\" he added.\n    De Bruyn said the tax on vegetable and marine oils and fats\nwould be wide open to fraud, difficult to police, and hugely\nexpensive administratively.\n    He also said the proposed tax contravened not only article\nthree of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the\nLome Convention, and the United Nations Food and Agriculture\nOrganization (FAO) guidelines, but also the EC's own Treaty.\n    The proposed tax would not only be inflationary but also\nhave consequences for employment and investment, he added.\n Reuter\n", "Southland Corp's subsidiary Citgo\nPetroleum said it raised its posted prices for crude oil across\nthe board by 50 cts a barrel, effective June 17.\n    Citgo said its new posting for West Texas Intermediate and\nWest Texas Sour is 19 dlrs a barrel.

Mining\nis monopolised by ZCCM and accounts for about 90 pct of the\ncountry's foreign exchange earnings.\n    Production has also been seriously affected in recent years\nby equipment breakdowns, deteriorating ore and shortages of\nspare parts, fuel and lubricants.

But with the current mineral export tax level being\nlevied, a net loss is likely to be registered.\n    ZCCM recorded a net loss of 718 mln kwacha in 1986 compared\nwith a net profit of 19 mln kwacha the year before.\n    Under the foreign exchange auction system introduced in\n1985, ZCCM's profits from its foreign exchange earnings rose as\nthe value of the kwacha fell to 21 to the dollar from just over\ntwo to the dollar.\n    But on May 1, President Kenneth Kaunda abolished the\nauctioning system, inspired by the International Monetary Fund,\nand announced Zambia would pursue a go-it-alone economic\nstrategy based on national resources.\n    ZCCM officials are still cautious over what effects the\nbreak with the IMF will have on the industry's plans.\n    \"We are still consulting to see how the new measures will\naffect us but it is too early to say just how we shall fare\nunder the new situation,\" Peter Hansen, director of operations\nand third in the ZCCM hierarchy, told Reuters.\n    Some analysts believe the new officially-fixed exchange\nrate of eight kwacha to the dollar will hit ZCCM's export\nprofits.\n    \"Most specialists I have talked to tell me the break-even\npoint for ZCCM is a rate of 10 kwacha per dollar,\" Frederick\nChiluba, leader of the Zambian Congress of Trade Unions said.\n    High production costs continue to bedevil the Zambian\nindustry.\n    Zambia mines copper at a relatively expensive rate of 69\ncents per pound, compared with 55 cents in the United States\nand under 40 cents in Chile.\n    The industry also faces transport problems due to Zambia\nbeing landlocked.

At that point, barring any increased\ntension in the Gulf or changes in OPEC's policies, prices\nshould begin easing.\n    \"OPEC will probably not do anything it hasn't already agreed\nto in December because oil prices are firm,\" said John Hill, a\nvice president at Merrill Lynch Futures.\n    OPEC agreed in December to maintain official oil prices at\n18 dlrs a barrel and raise the group's production ceiling to\n16.6 mln barrels per day in the third quarter and to 18.3 mln\nbarrels in the fourth quarter.\n    This agreement helped send prices sharply higher, rising\nfrom 15 dlrs a barrel in early December.\n    Several OPEC members who are price hawks, including Iran,\nAlgeria and Libya, will seek a higher official price and a\nreduction in output.\n    \"And if U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude continues to\ntrade above 20 dlrs a barrel, there is a greater chance that\nOPEC will raise its official 18 dlrs price,\" said Nauman\nBarakat, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co.\n    But most analysts expect the more moderate producers, such\nas Saudi Arabia, to block any changes in policy.\n    \"The meeting will be a non-event with no change in the\nofficial prices because OPEC, and in particular the Saudis, are\ncommitted to stabilizing the market,\" said Rosario Ilacqua,\nanalyst with L.F.
